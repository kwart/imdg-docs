= Configuration Pattern Matcher
[[configuration-pattern-matcher]]

You can give a custom strategy to match an item name to a configuration pattern. By
default Hazelcast uses a simplified wildcard matching. See xref:using-wildcards.adoc[Using Wildcards section]
for this.
A custom configuration pattern matcher can be given by using either member or client `config`
objects, as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// Setting a custom config pattern matcher via member config object
Config config = new Config();
config.setConfigPatternMatcher(new ExampleConfigPatternMatcher());
----

And the following is an example pattern matcher:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/ExampleConfigPatternMatcher.java[tag=patternmatcher]
