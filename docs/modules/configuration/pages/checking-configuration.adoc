= Checking Configuration
[[checking-configuration]]

When you start a Hazelcast member without passing a `Config` object, as explained
in the xref:configuring-programmatically.adoc[Configuring Programmatically section],
Hazelcast checks the member's configuration as follows:

* First, it looks for the `hazelcast.config` system property. If it is set, its
value is used as the path. This is useful if you want to be able to change your
Hazelcast configuration; you can do this because it is not embedded within the
application. You can set the `config` option with the following command:
+
```
-Dhazelcast.config=`*`<path to the hazelcast.xml or hazelcast.yaml>
```
+
[NOTE]
====
The suffix of the filename is used to determine the language of the configuration.
If the suffix is `.xml` the
configuration file is parsed as an
XML configuration file. If it is `.yaml`, the configuration file is parsed as a
YAML configuration file.
====
+
The path can be a regular one or a classpath reference with the prefix `classpath:`.
* If the above system property is not set, Hazelcast then checks whether there is
a `hazelcast.xml` file in the working directory.
* If not, it then checks whether `hazelcast.xml` exists on the classpath.
* If not, it then checks whether `hazelcast.yaml` (or `.yml`) exists in the working directory.
* If not, it then checks whether `hazelcast.yaml` (or `.yml`) exists on the classpath.
* If none of the above works, Hazelcast loads the default configuration
(`hazelcast.xml`) that comes with your Hazelcast package.

Before configuring Hazelcast, please try to work with the default configuration
to see if it works for you. This default configuration should be fine for most of
the users. If not, you can consider to modify the configuration to be more suitable
for your environment.
