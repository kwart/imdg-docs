= Configuring with System Properties
[[configuring-with-system-properties]]

You can use system properties to configure some aspects of Hazelcast. You set
these properties as name and value pairs through declarative configuration,
programmatic configuration or JVM system property. Following are examples for
each option.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.property.foo">value</property>
    </properties>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
    ...
    properties:
      hazelcast.property.foo: value
    ...
----
====

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );
----

**Using JVM's `System` class or `-D` argument:**

`System.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );`

or

`java -Dhazelcast.property.foo=value`

You will see Hazelcast system properties mentioned throughout this Reference Manual
as required in some of the chapters and sections. All Hazelcast system properties
are listed in the xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] with their
descriptions, default values and property types as a reference for you.
