A simple option for deploying Hazelcast is https://cloud.hazelcast.com/sign-up[Hazelcast Cloud^]. It delivers
enterprise-grade Hazelcast software in the cloud. You can deploy, scale
and update your Hazelcast easily using Hazelcast Cloud; it maintains the
clusters for you. You can use Hazelcast Cloud as a low-latency high-performance
caching or data layer for your microservices, and it is also a nice solution
for state management of serverless functions (AWS Lambda).

Hazelcast Cloud supports deployment of clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and as of early December
2020, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Since it is based on Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise it features advanced functionality
such as TLS, multi-region, multi-cloud & hybrid cloud cluster replication, persistence, and high availability.
