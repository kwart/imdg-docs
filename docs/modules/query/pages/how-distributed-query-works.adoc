= How Distributed Query Works

The requested predicate is sent to each member in the cluster.
Each member looks at its own local entries and filters them according
to the predicate. At this stage, key/value pairs of the entries are
deserialized and then passed to the predicate.
The predicate requester merges all the results coming from each
member into a single set.

Distributed query is highly scalable. If you add new members to the
cluster, the partition count for each member is reduced and thus the
time spent by each member on iterating its entries is reduced. In addition,
the pool of partition threads evaluates the entries concurrently in each
member and the network traffic is also reduced since only filtered data
is sent to the requester.

Hazelcast offers the following APIs for distributed query purposes:

* Criteria API
* Distributed SQL Query

== Employee Map Query Example

Assume that you have an "employee" map containing values of
`Employee` objects, as coded below.

[source,java]
----
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private boolean active;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, int age, boolean active, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.active = active;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public Employee() {
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public boolean isActive() {
        return active;
    }
}
----

Now let's look for the employees who are active and have an age less
than 30 using the aforementioned APIs (Criteria API and Distributed
SQL Query). The following subsections describe each query mechanism
for this example.

NOTE: When using Portable objects, if one field of an object exists
on one member but does not exist on another one, Hazelcast does not
throw an unknown field exception.
Instead, Hazelcast treats that predicate, which tries to perform a
query on an unknown field, as an always false predicate.

== Querying with Criteria API

Criteria API is a programming interface offered by Hazelcast that
is similar to the Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL). Below
is the code for the <<employee-map-query-example, above example query>>.

[source,java]
----
IMap<String, Employee> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "employee" );

EntryObject e = Predicates.newPredicateBuilder().getEntryObject();
Predicate predicate = e.is( "active" ).and( e.get( "age" ).lessThan( 30 ) );

Collection<Employee> employees = map.values( predicate );
----

In the above example code, `predicate` verifies whether the entry is
active and its `age` value is less than 30. This `predicate` is
applied to the `employee` map using the `map.values(predicate)` method.
This method sends the predicate to all cluster members
and merges the results coming from them. Since the predicate is
communicated between the members, it needs to
be serializable.

NOTE: Predicates can also be applied to `keySet`, `entrySet` and
`localKeySet` of the Hazelcast distributed map.

=== Predicates Class Operators

The `Predicates` class includes many operators for your query requirements.
The following are descriptions for some of them:

* `equal`: Checks if the result of an expression is equal to a given value.
* `notEqual`: Checks if the result of an expression is not equal to a given value.
* `instanceOf`: Checks if the result of an expression has a certain type.
* `like`: Checks if the result of an expression matches some string pattern. %
(percentage sign) is the placeholder for many characters,  (underscore) is
placeholder for only one character.
* `greaterThan`: Checks if the result of an expression is greater than a
certain value.
* `greaterEqual`: Checks if the result of an expression is greater than or
equal to a certain value.
* `lessThan`: Checks if the result of an expression is less than a certain
value.
* `lessEqual`: Checks if the result of an expression is less than or equal
to a certain value.
* `between`: Checks if the result of an expression is between two values
(this is inclusive).
* `in`: Checks if the result of an expression is an element of a certain
collection.
* `isNot`: Checks if the result of an expression is false.
* `regex`: Checks if the result of an expression matches some regular
expression.

NOTE: See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/query/Predicates.html[Predicates Javadoc^]
for all predicates provided.

=== Combining Predicates with AND, OR, NOT

You can combine predicates using the `and`, `or` and `not` operators,
as shown in the below examples.

[source,java]
----
public Collection<Employee> getWithNameAndAge( String name, int age ) {
    Predicate namePredicate = Predicates.equal( "name", name );
    Predicate agePredicate = Predicates.equal( "age", age );
    Predicate predicate = Predicates.and( namePredicate, agePredicate );
    return employeeMap.values( predicate );
}
----

[source,java]
----
public Collection<Employee> getWithNameOrAge( String name, int age ) {
    Predicate namePredicate = Predicates.equal( "name", name );
    Predicate agePredicate = Predicates.equal( "age", age );
    Predicate predicate = Predicates.or( namePredicate, agePredicate );
    return employeeMap.values( predicate );
}
----

[source,java]
----
public Collection<Employee> getNotWithName( String name ) {
    Predicate namePredicate = Predicates.equal( "name", name );
    Predicate predicate = Predicates.not( namePredicate );
    return employeeMap.values( predicate );
}
----

=== Simplifying with PredicateBuilder

You can simplify predicate usage with the `PredicateBuilder` interface,
which offers simpler predicate building. See the
below example code which selects all people with a certain name and age.

[source,java]
----
public Collection<Employee> getWithNameAndAgeSimplified( String name, int age ) {
    EntryObject e = Predicates.newPredicateBuilder().getEntryObject();
    Predicate agePredicate = e.get( "age" ).equal( age );
    Predicate predicate = e.get( "name" ).equal( name ).and( agePredicate );
    return employeeMap.values( predicate );
}
----

== Querying with SQL

`com.hazelcast.query.SqlPredicate` takes the regular SQL `where` clause.
Here is an example:

[source,java]
----
IMap<String, Employee> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "employee" );
Set<Employee> employees = map.values( new SqlPredicate( "active AND age < 30" ) );
----

=== Supported SQL Syntax

**AND/OR:** `<expression> AND <expression> AND <expression>... `

* `active AND age>30`
* `active=false OR age = 45 OR name = 'Joe'`
* `active AND ( age > 20 OR salary < 60000 )`

**Equality:** `=, !=, <, <=, >, >=`

* `<expression> = value`
* `age <= 30`
* `name = 'Joe'`
* `salary != 50000`

**BETWEEN: ** `<attribute> [NOT] BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>`

* `age BETWEEN 20 AND 33 ( same as age >= 20  AND age <= 33 )`
* `age NOT BETWEEN 30 AND 40 ( same as age < 30 OR age > 40 )`


**IN:** `<attribute> [NOT] IN (val1, val2,...)`

* `age IN ( 20, 30, 40 )`
* `age NOT IN ( 60, 70 )`
* `active AND ( salary >= 50000 OR ( age NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30 ) )`
* `age IN ( 20, 30, 40 ) AND salary BETWEEN ( 50000, 80000 )`

**LIKE:** `<attribute> [NOT] LIKE "expression"`

The `%` (percentage sign) is placeholder for multiple characters,
an `_` (underscore) is placeholder for only one character.

* `name LIKE 'Jo%'` (true for 'Joe', 'Josh', 'Joseph' etc.)
* `name LIKE 'Jo_'` (true for 'Joe'; false for 'Josh')
* `name NOT LIKE 'Jo_'` (true for 'Josh'; false for 'Joe')
* `name LIKE 'J_s%'` (true for 'Josh', 'Joseph'; false 'John', 'Joe')


**ILIKE:** `<attribute> [NOT] ILIKE 'expression'`

Similar to LIKE predicate but in a case-insensitive manner.

* `name ILIKE 'Jo%'` (true for 'Joe', 'joe', 'jOe','Josh','joSH', etc.)
* `name ILIKE 'Jo_'` (true for 'Joe' or 'jOE'; false for 'Josh')

**REGEX**: `<attribute> [NOT] REGEX 'expression'`

* `name REGEX 'abc-.*'` (true for 'abc-123'; false for 'abx-123')

NOTE: You can escape the `%` and `_` placeholder characters in your
SQL queries with predicates using the
backslash (`\`) character. The apostrophe (`'`) can be escaped with another
apostrophe, i.e., `''`. If you use REGEX, you need to escape characters
according to the normal Java escape syntax; see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[here^]
for the details.

=== Querying Entry Keys with Predicates

You can use `__key` attribute to perform a predicated search for entry
keys. See the following example:

[source,java]
----
IMap<String, Person> personMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap(persons);
personMap.put("Alice", new Person("Alice", 35, Gender.FEMALE));
personMap.put("Andy",  new Person("Andy",  37, Gender.MALE));
personMap.put("Bob",   new Person("Bob",   22, Gender.MALE));
[...]
Predicate predicate = Predicates.sql("__key like A%");
Collection<Person> startingWithA = personMap.values(predicate);
----

In this example, the code creates a collection with the entries whose
keys start with the letter "A‚Äù.

=== Querying JSON Strings

You can query JSON strings stored inside your Hazelcast clusters. To
query a JSON string,
you first need to create a `HazelcastJsonValue` from the JSON string.
You can use ``HazelcastJsonValue``s both as keys and values in the
distributed data structures. Then, it is
possible to query these objects using the Hazelcast query methods
explained in this section.

[source,java]
----
String person1 = "{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 35 }";
String person2 = "{ \"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 24 }";
String person3 = "{ \"name\": \"Trey\", \"age\": 17 }";

IMap<Integer, HazelcastJsonValue> idPersonMap = instance.getMap("jsonValues");

idPersonMap.put(1, new HazelcastJsonValue(person1));
idPersonMap.put(2, new HazelcastJsonValue(person2));
idPersonMap.put(3, new HazelcastJsonValue(person3));

Collection<HazelcastJsonValue> peopleUnder21 = idPersonMap.values(Predicates.lessThan("age", 21));
----

When running the queries, Hazelcast treats values extracted from
the JSON documents as Java types so they
can be compared with the query attribute. JSON specification
defines five primitive types to be used in the JSON
documents: `number`,`string`, `true`, `false` and `null`. The `string`,
`true/false` and `null` types are treated
as `String`, `boolean` and `null`, respectively. We treat the extracted
`number` values as ``long``s if they
can be represented by a `long`. Otherwise, ``number``s are treated
as ``double``s.

It is possible to query nested attributes and arrays in JSON documents.
The query syntax is the same
as querying other Hazelcast objects as explained in the
xref:querying-collections-and-arrays.adoc[Querying in Collections and Arrays section].

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Sample JSON object
 *
 * {
 *     "departmentId": 1,
 *     "room": "alpha",
 *     "people": [
 *         {
 *             "name": "Peter",
 *             "age": 26,
 *             "salary": 50000
 *         },
 *         {
 *             "name": "Jonah",
 *             "age": 50,
 *             "salary": 140000
 *         }
 *     ]
 * }
 *
 *
 * The following query finds all the departments that have a person named "Peter" working in them.
 */
Collection<HazelcastJsonValue> departmentWithPeter = departments.values(Predicates.equal("people[any].name", "Peter"));
----

`HazelcastJsonValue` is a lightweight wrapper around your JSON strings.
It is used merely as a way to indicate
that the contained string should be treated as a valid JSON value.
Hazelcast does not check the validity of JSON
strings put into to maps. Putting an invalid JSON string in a map is
permissible. However, in that case
whether such an entry is going to be returned or not from a query is not defined.

=== Metadata Creation for JSON Querying

Hazelcast stores a metadata object per `HazelcastJsonValue` stored.
This metadata object is created every time
a `HazelcastJsonValue` is put into an IMap. Metadata is later used
to speed up the query operations. Metadata creation
is on by default. Depending on your application's needs, you may want
to turn off the metadata creation
to decrease the put latency and increase the throughput. You can configure
this using xref:data-structures:map.adoc#metadata-policy[Metadata Policy].

NOTE: JSON metadata is stored on-heap even when you use the `NATIVE`
in-memory format. If you are storing
``HazelcastJsonValue``s in your `NATIVE` maps, there is a certain
amount of on-heap cost per object. Metadata is not created unless you
put ``HazelcastJsonValue``s in your `NATIVE` maps even when metadata
creation is on.

== Filtering with Paging Predicates

Hazelcast provides paging for defined predicates. With its `PagingPredicate`
interface, you can
get a collection of keys, values, or entries page by page by filtering
them with predicates and giving the size of the pages. Also, you
can sort the entries by specifying comparators. In this case, the comparator
should be `Serializable` and the serialization factory implementations you use,
e.g., `PortableFactory` and `DataSerializableFactory`, should be registered.
See the xref:serialization:serialization.adoc[Serialization chapter] on how to register these
factories.

Paging predicates require the objects to be deserialized both on the calling
side (either a member or client) and the member side from which the collection
is retrieved. Therefore, you need to register the serialization factories
you use on all the members and clients on which the paging predicates are used.
See the xref:serialization:serialization.adoc[Serialization chapter] on how to register these
factories.

In the example code below:

* The `greaterEqual` predicate gets values from the "students" map. This
predicate has a filter
to retrieve the objects with an "age" greater than or equal to 18.
* Then a `PagingPredicate` is constructed in which the page size is 5,
so that there are five objects in each page.
The first time the values are called creates the first page.
* It gets subsequent pages with the `nextPage()`
method of `PagingPredicate` and querying the map again with the
updated `PagingPredicate`.

[source,java]
----
IMap<Integer, Student> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "students" );
Predicate greaterEqual = Predicates.greaterEqual( "age", 18 );
PagingPredicate pagingPredicate = new PagingPredicate( greaterEqual, 5 );
// Retrieve the first page
Collection<Student> values = map.values( pagingPredicate );
...
// Set up next page
pagingPredicate.nextPage();
// Retrieve next page
values = map.values( pagingPredicate );
...
----

If a comparator is not specified for `PagingPredicate`, but you want
to get a collection of keys or values page by page, keys or values must
be instances of `Comparable` (i.e., they must implement `java.lang.Comparable`).
Otherwise, the `java.lang.IllegalArgument` exception is thrown.

You can also access a specific page more
easily with the help of the `setPage()` method. This way, if you make
a query for the hundredth page, for example, it gets all 100 pages at
once instead of reaching the hundredth page one by one using the `nextPage()` method.
Note that this feature tires the memory and see the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/query/PagingPredicate.html[PagingPredicate Javadoc^].

NOTE: Paging Predicate, also known as Order & Limit, is not supported in
Transactional Context.

== Filtering with Partition Predicate

You can run queries on a single partition in your cluster using
the partition predicate (`PartitionPredicate`).

The `Predicates.partitionPredicate()` method takes a predicate and partition key
as parameters, gets the partition ID using the key and  runs that predicate only
on the partition where that key belongs.

See the following code snippet:

[source,java]
----
...
Predicate predicate = new PartitionPredicate<String, Integer>(partitionKey, TruePredicate.INSTANCE);

Collection<Integer> values = map.values(predicate);
Collection<String> keys = map.keySet(predicate);
...
----

By default there are 271 partitions, and using a regular predicate,
each partition needs to be accessed. However, if the
partition predicate only accesses a single partition, this can lead
to a big performance gain.

For the partition predicate to work correctly, you need to know which
partition your data belongs to so that you can send the
request to the correct partition. One of the ways of doing it is to
make use of the `PartitionAware` interface when data is
inserted, thereby controlling the owning partition. See the
xref:performance:data-affinity.adoc#partitionaware[PartitionAware section] for more information and examples.

A concrete example may be a web shop that sells phones and accessories.
To find all the accessories of a phone,
a query could be executed that selects all accessories for that phone.
This query is executed on all members in the cluster and
therefore could generate quite a lot of load. However, if we would store
the accessories in the same partition as the phone, the
partition predicate could use the `partitionKey` of the phone to select
the right partition and then it queries for
the accessories for that phone; and this reduces the load on the system
and get faster query results.

== Indexing Queries

Hazelcast distributed queries run on each member in parallel and return
only the results to the caller.
Then, on the caller side, the results are merged.

When a query runs on a
member, Hazelcast iterates through all the owned entries and finds the
matching ones. This can be made faster by indexing
the most-queried fields, just like you would do for your database.
Indexing adds overhead for each write
operation but reading will be a lot faster. If you query your map a
lot, make sure to add indexes for the most frequently
queried fields. For example, if you do `active AND age < 30` query,
make sure you add an index for the `active` and
`age` fields. The following example code does that by getting the map
from the Hazelcast instance and adding indexes to the map with the
IMap `addIndex` method.

[source,java]
----
IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "employees" );
// ordered, since we have ranged queries for this field
map.addIndex( "age", true );
// not ordered, because boolean field cannot have range
map.addIndex( "active", false );
----

=== Indexing Ranged Queries

`IMap.addIndex(IndexConfig)` is used for adding index. For
each indexed field, if you have ranged queries such as `age>30`,
`age BETWEEN 40 AND 60`, then use `IndexType.SORTED` index
Otherwise, use `IndexType.HASH`.

=== Configuring IMap Indexes

Also, you can define `IMap` indexes in configuration. An example is
shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="default">
        <indexes>
            <index ordered="false">name</index>
            <index ordered="true">age</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

You can also define `IMap` indexes using programmatic configuration,
as in the example below.

[source,java]
----
mapConfig.addMapIndexConfig( new MapIndexConfig( "name", false ) );
mapConfig.addMapIndexConfig( new MapIndexConfig( "age", true ) );
----

The following is the Spring declarative configuration for the same
example.

[source,xml]
----
<hz:map name="default">
    <hz:indexes>
        <hz:index attribute="name"/>
        <hz:index attribute="age" ordered="true"/>
    </hz:indexes>
</hz:map>
----

NOTE: Non-primitive types to be indexed should implement *`Comparable`*.

NOTE: If you configure the data structure to use
xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc#configuring-high-density-memory-store[High-Density Memory Store] **and**
indexes, the indexes are automatically stored in the High-Density Memory Store
as well. This prevents from running into full garbage collections when doing
a lot of updates to index.

=== Composite Indexes

Composite indexes, also known as compound indexes, are special kind of
indexes that are built on top of the multiple map entry attributes and
therefore may be used to significantly speed up the queries involving
those attributes simultaneously.

There are two distinct composite index types used for two different
purposes: unordered composite indexes and ordered ones.

==== Unordered Composite Indexes

The unordered indexes are used to perform equality queries, also known
as the point queries, e.g., `name = 'Alice'`. These are specifically
optimized for equality queries and don't support other comparison operators
like `>` or `+<=+`.

Additionally, the _composite_ unordered indexes allow speeding up the equality
queries involving multiple attributes simultaneously, e.g., `name = 'Alice'
and age = 33`. This example query results in a single composite index lookup
operation which can be performed very efficiently.

The unordered composite index on the `name` and `age` attributes may be
configured for a map as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="persons">
        <indexes>
            <index ordered="false">name, age</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The attributes indexed by the _unordered_ composite indexes can't be
matched partially: the `name = 'Alice'` query can't utilize the composite
index configured above.

==== Ordered Composite Indexes

The ordered indexes are specifically designed to perform efficient order
comparison queries, also known as the range queries, e.g., `age > 33`. The
equality queries, like `age = 33`, are still supported by the ordered indexes,
but they are handled in a slightly less efficient manner comparing to the
unordered indexes.

The _composite_ ordered indexes extend the concept by allowing multiple
equality predicates and a single order comparison predicate to be combined
into a single index query operation. For instance, the `name = 'Alice' and
age > 33` and `name = 'Bob' and age = 33 and balance > 0.0` queries are good
candidates to be covered by an ordered composite index configured as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="persons">
        <indexes>
            <index ordered="true">name, age, balance</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

Unlike the _unordered_ composite indexes, partial attribute prefixes may be
matched for the _ordered_ composite indexes. In general, a valid non-empty
attribute prefix is formed as a sequence of zero or more equality predicates
followed by a zero or exactly one order comparison predicate. Given the index
definition above, the following queries may be served by the index: `name = 'Alice'`,
`name > 'Alice'`, `name = 'Alice' and age > 33`, `name = 'Alice' and age = 33 and
balance = 5.0`. The following queries can't be served the index: `age = 33`,
`age > 33 and balance = 0.0`, `balance > 0.0`.

While matching the ordered composite indexes, multiple order comparison
predicates acting on the same attribute are treated as a single range
predicate acting on that attribute. Given the index definition above, the
following queries may be served by the index: `name > 'Alice' and name < 'Bob'`,
`name = 'Alice' and age > 33 and age < 55`, `name = 'Alice' and age = 33 and
balance > 0.0 and balance < 100.0`.

==== Composite Index Matching and Selection

The order of attributes involved in a query plays no role in the selection
of the matching composite index: `name = 'Alice' and age = 33` and
`age = 33 and name = 'Alice'` queries are equivalent from the point of
view of the index matching procedure.

The attributes involved in a query can be matched partially by the composite
index matcher: `name = 'Alice' and age = 33 and balance > 0.0` can be
partially matched by the `name, age` composite index, the `name = 'Alice'
and age = 33` predicates are served by the matched index, while the
`balance > 0.0` predicate is processed by other means.

=== Bitmap Indexes

Bitmap indexes provide capabilities similar to unordered/hash indexes.
The same set of predicates is supported:

* `equal`
* `notEqual`
* `in`,
* `and`
* `or`
* `not`

But, unlike hash indexes, bitmap indexes are able
to achieve a much higher memory efficiency for low cardinality attributes
at the cost of reduced query performance. In practice, the query
performance is comparable to the performance of hash indexes, while
memory footprint reduction is high, usually around an order of magnitude.

Bitmap indexes are specifically designed for indexing of collection and
array attributes since a single `IMap` entry produces many index entries
in that case. A single hash index entry costs a few tens of bytes, while
a single bitmap index entry usually costs just a few bytes.

It's also possible to improve the memory footprint while indexing regular
single-value attributes, but the improvement is usually minor, depending
on the data layout and total number of indexes.

NOTE: Currently, bitmap indexes are not supported by off-heap High-Density
Memory Stores (HD).

==== Configuring Bitmap Indexes

In the simplest form, bitmap index for an `IMap` entry attribute can be
declaratively configured as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="persons">
        <indexes>
            <index>BITMAP(age)</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

Internally, a unique non-negative `long` ID is assigned to every
indexed `IMap` entry based on the entry key. That unique ID is
required for bitmap indexes to distinguish one indexed `IMap` entry from
another.

The mapping between `IMap` entries and `long` IDs is not free and its
performance and memory footprint can be improved in certain cases. For
instance, if `IMap` entries already have a unique integer-valued
attribute, the attribute values can be used as unique `long` IDs
directly without any additional transformations. That can be configured
as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="persons">
        <indexes>
            <index>BITMAP(age, uniqueId, RAW)</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The index definition above instructs Hazelcast to create a bitmap index
on the `age` attribute, extract the unique key values from `uniqueId` attribute
and use the raw (`RAW`) extracted values directly as `long` IDs. If the
extracted unique key value is not of `long` type, the widening
conversion is performed for the following types: `byte`, `short` and
`int`; boxed variants are also supported.

In certain cases, the extracted raw IDs might be randomly distributed.
This causes increased memory usage in bitmap indexes since the best case
scenario for them is sequential contiguous IDs. That can be countered by
applying the renumbering technique:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="persons">
        <indexes>
            <index>BITMAP(age, uniqueId, LONG)</index>
        </indexes>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The index definition above instructs the bitmap index to extract the unique
keys from `uniqueId` attribute, convert every extracted non-negative
value to `long` (`LONG`) and assign an internal sequential unique `long`
ID based on that extracted and then converted unique value. The widening
conversion is applied to the extracted values, if necessary.

This long-to-long mapping is performed more efficiently than the general
object-to-long mapping done for the simple index definitions. Basically,
a simple bitmap index definition like `BITMAP(age)` is equivalent to the
following full-form definition: `BITMAP(age, __key, OBJECT)`, which
indexes `age` attribute, uses `IMap` entry keys (`__key`) interpreted
as Java objects (`OBJECT`) to assign internal unique `long` IDs.

The full-form definition syntax is defined as follows:

[source,plain]
----
BITMAP(<attr>, <key>, <transform>)
----

The following are the parameter descriptions:

* `<attr>`: Specifies the attribute index.
* `<key>`: Specifies the attribute to use as a unique key source
for internal unique `long` ID assignment.
* `<transform>`: Specifies the transformation to be applied
to unique keys to generate unique `long` IDs from them. The following
transformations are supported:
** `OBJECT`: Object-to-long transformation. Each extracted unique
key value is interpreted as a Java object instance. Internally, an
object-to-long hash table is used to establish the mapping from unique
keys to unique IDs. Good as a general-purpose transformation.
** `LONG`: Long-to-long transformation. Each extracted unique key value
is interpreted as a non-negative `long` value, the widening conversion
from `byte`, `short` and `int` is performed, if necessary.
Internally, a long-to-long hash table is used to establish the mapping
from unique keys to unique IDs, which is more efficient than the
object-to-long hash table. It is good for sparse/random unique integer-valued keys
renumbering to raise the IDs density and to make the bitmap index more
memory-efficient as a result.
** `RAW`: Raw transformation. Each extracted unique key value is interpreted as
a non-negative `long` value, the widening conversion from `byte`, `short` and
`int` is performed, if necessary. Internally, no hash table of any kind is
used to establish the mapping from unique keys to unique IDs, the raw extracted
keys are used directly as IDs. It is good for dense unique integer-valued keys,
and it has the best performance in terms of time and memory.

The regular dotted attribute path syntax is supported for `<attr>` and
`<key>`:

[source,plain]
----
BITMAP(name.first)
BITMAP(name.first, __key, RAW)
BITMAP(name.first, __key.id, RAW)
BITMAP(name.first, id.external, RAW)
...
----

Collection and array indexing is also possible using the regular syntax:

[source,plain]
----
BITMAP(habits[any])
BITMAP(habits[0], __key, RAW)
...
----

See xref:querying-collections-and-arrays.adoc#indexing-in-collections-and-arrays[Indexing in Collections and Arrays section]
for more details.

==== Bitmap Index Querying

Bitmap index matching and selection for queries are performed
automatically. No special treatment is required. The querying can be
performed using the regular `IMap` querying methods:
`IMap.values(Predicate)`, `IMap.entrySet(Predicate)`, etc.

=== Copying Indexes

The underlying data structures used by the indexes need to copy the
query results to make sure that the results are correct. This copying
process is performed either when reading the index from the data
structure (on-read) or writing to it (on-write).

On-read copying means that, for each index-read operation, the result
of the query is copied before it is sent to the caller. Depending on
the query result's size, this type of index copying may be slower since
the result is stored in a map, i.e., all entries need to have the hash
calculated before being stored. Unlike the index-read operations, each
index-write operation is fast, since there is no copying. So, this
option can be preferred in index-write intensive cases.

On-write copying means that each index-write operation completely copies
the underlying map to provide the copy-on-write semantics and this may
be a slow operation depending on the index size. Unlike index-write operations,
each index-read operation is fast since the operation only includes accessing
the map that stores the results and returning them to the caller.

Another option is never copying the results of a query to a separate map.
This means the results backed by the underlying index-map can change after
the query has been executed (such as an entry might have been added or removed
from an index, or it might have been remapped). This option can be preferred
if you expect "mostly correct" results, i.e., if it is not a problem when
some entries returned in the query result set do not match the initial query
criteria. This is the fastest option since there is no copying.

You can set one of these options using the system property
`hazelcast.index.copy.behavior`. The following values, which are explained
in the above paragraphs, can be set:

* `COPY_ON_READ` (the default value)
* `COPY_ON_WRITE`
* `NEVER`

NOTE: Usage of this system property is supported for BINARY and OBJECT
in-memory formats. Only in Hazelcast 3.8.7, it is also supported for
NATIVE in-memory format.

=== Indexing Attributes with ValueExtractor

You can also define custom attributes that may be referenced in predicates,
queries and indexes. Custom attributes can be defined by implementing a
`ValueExtractor`. See the xref:custom-attributes.adoc[Custom Attributes section]
for details.

=== Using "this" as an Attribute

You can use the keyword `this` as an attribute name while adding an
index or creating a predicate. A basic usage is shown below.

[source,java]
----
map.addIndex("this", true);
Predicate<Integer, Integer> lessEqual = Predicates.between("this", 12, 20);
----

Another basic example using `SqlPredicate` is shown below.

[source,java]
----
new SqlPredicate("this = 'jones'")
new SqlPredicate("this.age > 33")
----

The special attribute `this` acts on the value of a map entry. Typically,
you do not need to specify it while accessing a property of an entry's
value, since its presence is implicitly assumed if the special attribute
<<querying-entry-keys-with-predicates, __key>> is not specified.

== Configuring Query Thread Pool

You can change the size of thread pool dedicated to query operations
using the `pool-size` property. Each query consumes a single thread
from a Generic Operations ThreadPool on each Hazelcast member - let's
call it the query-orchestrating thread.  That thread is blocked throughout
the whole execution-span of a query on the member.

The query-orchestrating thread uses the threads from the query-thread
pool in the following cases:

* if you run a `PagingPredicate` (since each page runs as a separate task)
* if you set the system property `hazelcast.query.predicate.parallel.evaluation`
to true (since the predicates are evaluated in parallel)

See the <<filtering-with-paging-predicates, Filtering with Paging Predicates section>>
and xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc#parallel-predicates[System Properties appendix] for information on paging
predicates and for description of the above system property.

Below is an example of that declarative configuration.

Below is the equivalent programmatic configuration.

[source,java]
----
Config cfg = new Config();
cfg.getExecutorConfig("hz:query").setPoolSize(100);

=== Query Requests from Clients

When dealing with the query requests coming from the clients to your
members, Hazelcast offers the following system properties to tune your
thread pools:

* `hazelcast.clientengine.thread.count` which is the number of threads
to process non-partition-aware client requests, like `map.size()` and
executor tasks. Its default value is the number of cores multiplied by 20.
* `hazelcast.clientengine.query.thread.count` which is the number of
threads to process query requests coming from the clients. Its default
value is the number of cores.

If there are a lot of query request from the clients, you may want to
increase the value of `hazelcast.clientengine.query.thread.count`. In
addition to this tuning, you may also consider increasing the value of
`hazelcast.clientengine.thread.count` if the CPU load in your system is
not high and there is plenty of free memory.
