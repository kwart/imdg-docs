= Distributed Query

Distributed queries access data from multiple data sources stored on
either the same or different members.

Hazelcast partitions your data and spreads it across cluster of members.
You can iterate over the map entries and look for certain entries
(specified by predicates) you are interested in. However, this is not
very efficient because you have to bring the entire entry set and iterate
locally. Instead, Hazelcast allows you to run distributed queries on your
distributed map.
