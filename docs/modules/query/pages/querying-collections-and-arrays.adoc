= Querying in Collections and Arrays

Hazelcast allows querying in collections and arrays.
Querying in collections and arrays is compatible with all Hazelcast
serialization methods, including the Portable serialization.


Let's have a look at the following data structure expressed in pseudo-code:

[source,java]
----
class Motorbike {
    Wheel wheels[2];
}

class Wheel {
   String name;

}
----

In order to query a single element of a collection/array, you can execute the following query:

[source,java]
----
// it matches all motorbikes where the zero wheel's name is 'front-wheel'
Predicate p = Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", "front-wheel");
Collection<Motorbike> result = map.values(p);
----

It is also possible to query a collection/array using the `any` semantic as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// it matches all motorbikes where any wheel's name is 'front-wheel'
Predicate p = Predicates.equal("wheels[any].name", "front-wheel");
Collection<Motorbike> result = map.values(p);
----

The exact same query may be executed using the `SQLPredicate` as shown below:

[source,java]
----
Predicate p = new SqlPredicate("wheels[any].name = 'front-wheel'");
Collection<Motorbike> result = map.values(p);
----

`[]` notation applies to both collections and arrays.

[NOTE]
====
Hazelcast requires all elements of a collection to have the same type. Considering
and expanding the above example:

* If you have a `wheels` collection attribute, all of its elements must be of
the `Wheel` type, subclasses of `Wheel` are not allowed.
* Let’s say you have added a `seats` collection attribute, which is a `Seat`
object.  Then all of its elements must of this concrete `Seat` type.

So, you may have collections of different types in your map. However, each
collection’s elements must be of the same concrete type within that collection
attribute.

Consider custom attribute extractors if it is impossible or undesirable to reduce
the variety of types to a single type. See the xref:custom-attributes.adoc[Custom Attributes section]
for information on them.
====

== Indexing in Collections and Arrays

You can also create an index using a query in collections and arrays.

Please note that in order to leverage the index, the attribute name used
in the query has to be the same as the one used
in the index definition.

Let's assume you have the following index definition:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <indexes>
        <index ordered="false">wheels[any].name</index>
    </indexes>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The following query uses the index:

[source,java]
----
Predicate p = Predicates.equal("wheels[any].name", "front-wheel");
----

The following query, however, does NOT leverage the index, since it does
not use exactly the same attribute name that
was used in the index:

[source,java]
----
Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", "front-wheel")
----

In order to use the index in the case mentioned above, you have to create
another index, as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <indexes>
        <index ordered="false">wheels[0].name</index>
    </indexes>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

== Corner cases

Handling of corner cases may be a bit different than in a programming
language like `Java`.

Let's have a look at the following examples in order to understand the differences.
To make the analysis simpler, let's assume that there is only one `Motorbike`
object stored in a Hazelcast Map.

[cols="1,5,3,1,1"]
|===
|Id|Query|Data State|Extraction Result|Match

| 1
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[7].name", "front-wheel")`
| `wheels.size() == 1`
| `null`
| No

| 2
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[7].name", null)`
| `wheels.size() == 1`
| `null`
| Yes

| 3
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", "front-wheel")`
| `wheels[0].name == null`
| `null`
| No

| 4
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", null)`
| `wheels[0].name == null`
| `null`
| Yes

| 5
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", "front-wheel")`
| `wheels[0] == null`
| `null`
| No
| 6
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", null)`
| `wheels[0] == null`
| `null`
| Yes

| 7
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", "front-wheel")`
| `wheels == null`
| `null`
| No

| 8
| `Predicates.equal("wheels[0].name", null)`
| `wheels == null`
| `null`
| Yes
|===

As you can see, **no** ``NullPointerException``s or ``IndexOutOfBoundException``s
are thrown in the extraction process, even
though parts of the expression are `null`.

Looking at examples 4, 6 and 8, we can also easily notice that it is impossible to
distinguish which part of the
expression was null.
If we execute the following query `wheels[1].name = null`, it may be evaluated to
true because:

* `wheels` collection/array is null
* `index == 1` is out of bound
* `name` attribute of the wheels[1] object is `null`.

In order to make the query unambiguous, extra conditions would have to be added, e.g.,
`wheels != null AND wheels[1].name = null`.
