= Fast-Aggregations
[[fast-aggregations]]

Fast-Aggregations functionality is the successor of the xref:query:aggregators.adoc[Aggregators].
They are equivalent to the MapReduce Aggregators in most of the use cases, but instead
of running on the MapReduce engine they run on the Query infrastructure.
Their performance is tens to hundreds times better since they run in parallel for each
partition and are highly optimized for speed and low memory consumption.

NOTE: If the xref:data-structures:distributed-data-structures.adoc#setting-in-memory-format[in-memory format] of your data is `NATIVE`,
aggregations always run on the partition threads. If the data is of type `BINARY`
or `OBJECT`, they also mostly run on the partition threads, however, they may run on
the separate query threads to avoid blocking partition threads (if there are no ongoing migrations).

== Aggregator API

The Fast-Aggregation consists of three phases represented by three methods:

. `accumulate()`
. `combine()`
. `aggregate()`

There are also the following callbacks:

* `onAccumulationFinished()` called when the accumulation phase finishes
* `onCombinationFinished()` called when the combination phase finishes

These callbacks enable releasing the state that might have been initialized and
stored in the Aggregator - to reduce the network traffic.

Each phase is described below. See also the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/aggregation/Aggregator.html[Aggregator Javadoc^]
for the API's details.

**Accumulation:**

During the accumulation phase each Aggregator accumulates all entries passed
to it by the query engine.
It accumulates only those pieces of information that are required to calculate
the aggregation result in the last phase - that's implementation specific.

In case of the `DoubleAverage` aggregation the Aggregator would accumulate:

* the sum of the elements it accumulated
* the count of the elements it accumulated

**Combination:**

Since aggregation is executed in parallel on each partition of the cluster,
the results need to be combined after the accumulation phase in order to be able
to calculate the final result.

In case of the `DoubleAverage` aggregation, the aggregator would sum up all
the sums of the elements and all the counts.

**Aggregation:**

Aggregation is the last phase that calculates the final result from the
results accumulated and combined in the preceding phases.

In case of the `DoubleAverage` aggregation, the Aggregator would just
divide the sum of the elements by their count (if non-zero).

=== Fast-Aggregations and Map Interfaces

Aggregations are available on `com.hazelcast.map.IMap` only.
IMap offers the method `aggregate` to apply the aggregation logic on
the map entries. This method can be called with or without a predicate. You can refer
to its https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/IMap.html#aggregate-com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregator-[Javadoc^]
to see the method details.

== Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation of the Aggregator:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/distributedquery/SimpleFastAggregationsDemo.java[tag=fademo]
----

As you can see:

* the `accumulate()` method calculates the sum and count of the elements
* the `combine()` method combines the results from all the accumulations
* the `aggregate()` method calculates the final result.

== Built-In Aggregations

The `com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregators` class provides a wide variety of built-in Aggregators.
The full list is presented below:

* `count`
* `distinct`
* `bigDecimal` `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
* `bigInteger` `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
* `double` `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
* `integer` `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
* `long` `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
* `number` `avg`
* `comparable` `min`/`max`
* `fixedPointSum`, `floatingPointSum`

To use the any of these Aggregators, instantiate them using the `Aggregators`
factory class.

Each built-in Aggregator can also navigate to an attribute of the object passed
to the `accumulate()` method (via reflection). For example, `Aggregators.distinct("address.city")`
extracts the `address.city` attribute from the object passed to the Aggregator and
accumulate the extracted value.

== Configuration Options

On each partition, after the entries have been passed to the aggregator, the
accumulation runs in parallel.
It means that each aggregator is cloned and receives a sub-set of the entries
received from a partition.
Then, it runs the accumulation phase in all of the cloned aggregators - at the
end, the result is combined into a single accumulation result.
It speeds up the processing by at least the factor of two - even in case of simple
aggregations. If the accumulation logic is more "heavy", the speed-up may be more significant.

In order to switch the accumulation into a sequential mode just set the
`hazelcast.aggregation.accumulation.parallel.evaluation` property to `false`
(it's set to `true` by default).
