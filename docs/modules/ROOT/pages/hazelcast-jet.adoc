== Overview

Hazelcast Jet is a distributed batch and stream processing framework 
based on Hazelcast IMDG.  It allows you to write, currently, modern Java code
that focuses purely on data transformation while it does all the heavy 
lifting of getting the data flowing and computation running across a 
cluster of members.  It supports working with both bounded (batch) 
and unbounded (streaming) data.

You can follow the https://jet-start.sh/docs[Getting Started Guide^]
in the Hazelcast Jet documentation to see a simple example.

Jet supports a rich set of data transformations such as windowed aggregations.
For example, if your data is GPS location reports from millions of users,
Jet can compute every user's velocity vector by using a sliding window and
just a few lines of code. Jet also supports _at-least-once_ and _exactly-once_
processing.

Jet can be used to import/export data from/to
Hazelcast IMDG using a very wide variety of data sources including Hadoop,
S3, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, JDBC and JMS. For example, you can read data
from Kafka and write to `IMap` with just a few lines of code. You can 
https://jet-start.sh/docs/how-tos/stream-imap[_stream_ changes^] from an `IMap`
and write it to an external system or you can https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/map-join[join to a stream^]
reference data that is already stored in `IMap`.
