[[isemaphore]]

Hazelcast ISemaphore is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`.

NOTE: The original implementation of `ISemaphore` has been deprecated. To read about the previous implementation, see the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11.2/manual/html-single/index.html#isemaphore[ISemaphore] section of the Hazelcast IMDG 3.11 Reference Manual. The xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] introduces `ISemaphore` provided by the *CP Subsystem*.

== Controlling Thread Counts with Permits

Semaphores offer **permit**s to control the thread counts when performing concurrent activities.
To execute a concurrent activity, a thread grants a permit or waits until a permit
becomes available. When the execution is completed, the permit is released.

TIP: `ISemaphore` with a single permit may be considered as a lock. Unlike the locks,
when semaphores are used, any thread can release the permit depending on the configuration,
and semaphores can have multiple permits. For more information, see the xref:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#semaphore-configuration[Semaphore Configuration section].

WARNING: Hazelcast ISemaphore does not support fairness at all times. There are some edge cases
where the fairness is not honored, e.g., when the permit becomes available
at the time when an internal timeout occurs.

When a permit is acquired on ISemaphore:

* If there are permits, the number of permits in the semaphore is decreased by one
and the calling thread performs its activity. If there is contention,
the longest waiting thread acquires the permit before all other threads.
* If no permits are available, the calling thread blocks until a permit
becomes available. When a timeout happens during this block, the thread is interrupted.

[[example-semaphore-code]]
== Example Semaphore Code

The following example code uses an `IAtomicLong` resource 1000 times,
increments the resource when a thread starts to use it and decrements
it when the thread completes.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/semaphore/SemaphoreMember.java[tag=sm]
----

If you execute the above code 5 times,
the following output appears:

`At iteration: 0, Active Threads: 1`

`At iteration: 1, Active Threads: 2`

`At iteration: 2, Active Threads: 3`

`At iteration: 3, Active Threads: 3`

`At iteration: 4, Active Threads: 3`

As you can see, the maximum count of concurrent threads is equal or
smaller than three. If you remove the semaphore acquire/release statements
in the above example, you will see that there is no limitation on the number
of concurrent usages.
