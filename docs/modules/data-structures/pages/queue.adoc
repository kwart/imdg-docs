= Queue
[[queue]]

Hazelcast distributed queue is an implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`.
Being distributed, Hazelcast distributed queue enables all cluster members to interact with it.
Using Hazelcast distributed queue, you can add an item in one cluster member and remove it from another one.

[[getting-a-queue-and-putting-items]]
== Getting a Queue and Putting Items

Use the Hazelcast instance's `getQueue` method to get the queue, then use the queue's
`put` method to put items into the queue.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/ExampleQueue.java[tag=samplequeue]
----

FIFO ordering applies to all queue operations across the cluster. The user objects
(such as `MyTask` in the example above) that are enqueued or dequeued have to be `Serializable`.

Hazelcast distributed queue performs no batching while iterating over the queue.
All items are copied locally and iteration occurs locally.

Hazelcast distributed queue uses `ItemListener` to listen to the events that occur
when items are added to and removed from the queue. See the xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-item-events[Listening for Item Events section] for information on how to create an item listener
class and register it.

[[creating-an-example-queue]]
== Creating an Example Queue

The following example code illustrates a distributed queue that connects a producer and consumer.

[[putting-items-on-the-queue]]
=== Putting Items on the Queue

Let's `put` one integer on the queue every second, 100 integers total.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/ProducerMember.java[tag=producer]
----


`Producer` puts a **-1** on the queue to show that the ``put``s are finished.

[[taking-items-off-the-queue]]
=== Taking Items off the Queue

Now, let's create a `Consumer` class to `take` a message from this queue, as shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/ConsumerMember.java[tag=consumer]
----

As seen in the above example code, `Consumer` waits five seconds before it consumes
the next message. It stops once it receives **-1**. Also note that `Consumer`
puts **-1** back on the queue before the loop is ended.

When you first start `Producer` and then start `Consumer`, items produced on the
queue will be consumed from the same queue.

[[balancing-the-queue-operations]]
=== Balancing the Queue Operations

From the above example code, you can see that an item is produced every second and
consumed every five seconds. Therefore, the consumer keeps growing. To balance the
produce/consume operation, let's start another consumer. This way, consumption is
distributed to these two consumers, as seen in the example outputs below.

The second consumer is started. After a while, here is the first consumer output:

```
...
Consumed 13
Consumed 15
Consumer 17
...
```

Here is the second consumer output:

```
...
Consumed 14
Consumed 16
Consumer 18
...
```

In the case of a lot of producers and consumers for the queue, using a list of
queues may solve the queue bottlenecks. In this case, be aware that the order of the
messages sent to different queues is not guaranteed. Since in most cases strict ordering
is not important, a list of queues is a good solution.

NOTE: The items are taken from the queue in the same order they were put on the queue.
However, if there is more than one consumer, this order is not guaranteed.

[[itemids-when-offering-items]]
=== ItemIDs When Offering Items

Hazelcast gives an `itemId` for each item you offer, which is an incrementing sequence
identification for the queue items. You should consider the following to understand the
`itemId` assignment behavior:

* When a Hazelcast member has a queue and that queue is configured to have at least one
backup, and that member is restarted, the `itemId` assignment resumes from the last known
highest `itemId` before the restart; `itemId` assignment does not start from the beginning for the new items.
* When the whole cluster is restarted, the same behavior explained in the above
consideration applies if your queue has a persistent data store (`QueueStore`).
If the queue has `QueueStore`, the `itemId` for the new items are given, starting
from the highest `itemId` found in the IDs returned by the method `loadAllKeys`.
If the method `loadAllKeys` does not return anything, the ``itemId``s starts
from the beginning after a cluster restart.
* The above two considerations mean there are no duplicated ``itemId``s in the memory
or in the persistent data store.

[[setting-a-bounded-queue]]
== Setting a Bounded Queue

A bounded queue is a queue with a limited capacity. When the bounded queue is full,
no more items can be put into the queue until some items are taken out.

To turn a Hazelcast distributed queue into a bounded queue, set the capacity limit
with the `max-size` property. You can set the `max-size` property in the configuration,
as shown below. The `max-size` element specifies the maximum size of the queue.
Once the queue size reaches this value, `put` operations are blocked until the
queue size goes below `max-size`, which happens when a consumer removes items from the queue.

Let's set **10** as the maximum size of our example queue in <<creating-an-example-queue,
Creating an Example Queue>>.

When the producer is started, ten items are put into the queue and then the queue
will not allow more `put` operations. When the consumer is started, it will remove
items from the queue. This means that the producer can `put` more items into the
queue until there are ten items in the queue again, at which point the `put` operation
again becomes blocked.

In this example code, the producer is five times faster than the consumer.
It will effectively always be waiting for the consumer to remove items before
it can put more on the queue. For this example code, if maximum throughput is the goal,
it would be a good option to start multiple consumers to prevent the queue from filling up.

[[queueing-with-persistent-datastore]]
== Queueing with Persistent Datastore

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed queue items from/to a persistent
datastore using the interface `QueueStore`. If queue store is enabled, each item added to
the queue is also stored at the configured queue store. When the number of items in the
queue exceeds the memory limit, the subsequent items are persisted in the queue store,
they are not stored in the queue memory.

The `QueueStore` interface enables you to store, load and delete queue items with methods like
`store`, `storeAll`, `load` and `delete`. The following example class includes all of the `QueueStore` methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/TheQueueStore.java[tag=qs]

`Item` must be serializable. The following is an example queue store configuration.

          bulk-load: 500
----
====

The following are the descriptions for each queue store property:

* **Binary**: By default, Hazelcast stores the queue items in serialized form,
and before it inserts the queue items into the queue store, it deserializes them.
If you are not reaching the queue store from an external application, you might
prefer that the items be inserted in binary form. Do this by setting the `binary`
property to true: then you can get rid of the deserialization step, which is a performance
optimization. The `binary` property is false by default.
* **Memory Limit**: This is the number of items after which Hazelcast stores items
only to the datastore. For example, if the memory limit is 1000, then the 1001st item
is put only to the datastore. This feature is useful when you want to avoid out-of-memory
conditions. If you want to always use memory, you can set it to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
The default number for `memory-limit` is 1000.
* **Bulk Load**: When the queue is initialized, items are loaded from `QueueStore`
in bulks. Bulk load is the size of these bulks. The default value of `bulk-load` is 250.

[[split-brain-protection-for-queue]]
== Split-Brain Protection for Queue

Queues can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying queue operations (see the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section]).
This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

The following is a list of methods, grouped by the quorum type, that support Split-Brain Protection checks:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE
** `Collection.addAll()`
** `Collection.removeAll()`, `Collection.retainAll()`
** `BlockingQueue.offer()`, `BlockingQueue.add()`, `BlockingQueue.put()`
** `BlockingQueue.drainTo()`
** `IQueue.poll()`, `Queue.remove()`, `IQueue.take()`
** `BlockingQueue.remove()`
* READ, READ_WRITE
** `Collection.clear()`
** `Collection.containsAll()`, `BlockingQueue.contains()`
** `Collection.isEmpty()`
** `Collection.iterator()`, `Collection.toArray()`
** `Queue.peek()`, `Queue.element()`
** `Collection.size()`
** `BlockingQueue.remainingCapacity()`

[[configuring-queue]]
== Configuring Queue

The following are examples of queue configurations. It includes the
`QueueStore` configuration, which is explained in the <<queueing-with-persistent-datastore,

**Declarative Configuration:**

[source,xml]

        </queue-store>
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </queue>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/QueueConfiguration.java[tag=queueconf]
----

Hazelcast distributed queue has one synchronous backup by default.
By having this backup, when a cluster member with a queue goes down,
another member having the backup of that queue will continue. Therefore,
no items are lost. You can define the number of synchronous backups for a
queue using the `backup-count` element in the declarative configuration.
A queue can also have asynchronous backups: you can define the number of
asynchronous backups using the `async-backup-count` element.

To set the maximum size of the queue, use the `max-size` element.
To purge unused or empty queues after a period of time, use the `empty-queue-ttl` element.
If you define a value (time in seconds) for the `empty-queue-ttl` element,
then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for the time in seconds that you give.

The following is the full list of queue configuration elements with their descriptions:

* `max-size`: Maximum number of items in the queue. It is used to set an
upper bound for the queue. You will not be able to put more items when the
queue reaches to this maximum size whether you have a queue store configured or not.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. Queue is a non-partitioned
data structure, so all entries of a queue reside in one partition. When this
parameter is '1', it means there will be one backup of that queue in another
member in the cluster. When it is '2', two members will have the backup.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.
* `empty-queue-ttl`: Used to purge unused or empty queues. If you define a
value (time in seconds) for this element, then your queue will be destroyed
if it stays empty or unused for that time.
* `item-listeners`: Adds listeners (listener classes) for the queue items.
You can also set the attribute `include-value` to `true` if you want the item
event to contain the item values. You can set `local` to `true` if you want to
listen to the items on the local member.
* `queue-store`: Includes the queue store factory class name and the properties
*binary*, *memory limit* and *bulk load*. See the <<queueing-with-persistent-datastore, Queueing with Persistent Datastore section>>.
* `statistics-enabled`: Specifies whether the statistics gathering is enabled for your queue.
If set to `false`, you cannot collect statistics in your implementation
(using `getLocalQueueStats()`) and also
{mc-docs}#monitoring-queues[Hazelcast Management Center^]
will not show them. Its default value is `true`.
* `quorum-ref` : Name of quorum configuration that you want this queue to use.
