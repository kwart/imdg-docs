[[list]]

Hazelcast List (`IList`) is similar to Hazelcast Set, but it also
allows duplicate elements.

* Besides allowing duplicate elements, Hazelcast List preserves the order of elements.
* Hazelcast List is a non-partitioned data structure where values and each
backup are represented by their own single partition.
* Hazelcast List cannot be scaled beyond the capacity of a single machine.
* All items are copied to local and iteration occurs locally.


'''
NOTE: While IMap and ICache are the recommended data structures to be used by
https://jet.hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast Jet^], IList can also be used by it for unit
testing or similar non-production situations. See https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest/manual/#imdg-list[here^]
in the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual to learn how Jet can use IList, e.g., how it can fill
IList with data, consume it in a Jet job and drain the results to another IList.
See also the https://hazelcast.org/use-cases/fast-batch-processing/[Fast Batch Processing^]
and https://hazelcast.org/use-cases/real-time-stream-processing/[Real-Time Stream Processing^]
use cases for Hazelcast Jet.

== Getting a List and Putting Items

Use the ``HazelcastInstance``s `getList` method to get the List,
then use the `add` method to put items into it.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/list/ExampleList.java[tag=list]
----

Hazelcast List uses `ItemListener` to listen to events that occur when
items are added to and removed from the List. See the xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-item-events[Listening for Item Events section] for information on how to create an item listener
class and register it.

[[configuring-list]]
== Configuring List

The following are the example Hazelcast List configurations.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <list name="default">
        <backup-count>1</backup-count>
        <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>
        <max-size>10</max-size>
        <item-listeners>
            <item-listener>
                com.hazelcast.examples.ItemListener
            </item-listener>
        </item-listeners>
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </list>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/list/ListConfiguration.java[tag=lc]
----

Hazelcast List configuration has the following elements:

* `statistics-enabled`: True (default) if statistics gathering is
enabled on the list, false otherwise.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. List is a non-partitioned
data structure, so all entries of a List reside in one partition. When this
parameter is '1', there will be one backup of that List in another member in
the cluster. When it is '2', two members will have the backup.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.
* `max-size`: The maximum number of entries for this List.
* `item-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the list items.
You can also set the attribute `include-value` to `true` if you want the item event
to contain the item values. You can set the attribute `local` to `true` if you want
to listen the items on the local member.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this List to use.
See the <<split-brain-protection-for-ilist-and-transactionallist, Split-Brain Protection for IList and TransactionalList section>>.

[[split-brain-protection-for-ilist-and-transactionallist]]
== Split-Brain Protection for IList and TransactionalList

IList & TransactionalList can be configured to check for a minimum
number of available members before applying queue operations (see the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section]).
This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

The following is a list of methods, grouped by quorum type, that support split-brain protection checks:

IList:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `addAll`
** `clear`
** `remove`
** `removeAll`
** `set`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `contains`
** `containsAll`
** `get`
** `indexOf`
** `isEmpty`
** `iterator`
** `lastIndexOf`
** `listIterator`
** `size`
** `subList`
** `toArray`


TransactionalList:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `remove`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `size`


**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-brain protection for IList can be configured programmatically using
the method https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/ListConfig.html[setSplitBrainProtectionName()^],
or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <list name="default">
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </list>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section].
