= IAtomicReference
[[iatomicreference]]

The `IAtomicLong` is very useful if you need to deal with a long, but in some cases you need to deal with a reference. That is why Hazelcast also supports the `IAtomicReference` which is the distributed version of the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`.

NOTE: The original implementation of `IAtomicReference` has been deprecated. To read about the previous implementation, see the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11.2/manual/html-single/index.html#iatomicreference[IAtomicReference] section of the Hazelcast IMDG 3.11 Reference Manual. The xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] introduces `IAtomicReference` provided by the *CP Subsystem*.

Here is an IAtomicReference example.

When you execute the above example, the output is as follows:

`foo`

== Sending Functions to IAtomicReference

Just like `IAtomicLong`, `IAtomicReference` has methods that accept a
'function' as an argument, such as `alter`, `alterAndGet`, `getAndAlter` and `apply`.
There are two big advantages of using these methods:

* From a performance point of view, it is better to send the function to the data
than the data to the function. Often the function is a lot smaller than the data and
therefore cheaper to send over the line. Also the function only needs to be transferred
once to the target machine and the data needs to be transferred twice.
* You do not need to deal with concurrency control. If you would perform a load, transform,
store, you could run into a data race since another thread might have updated the value you
are about to overwrite.

== Using IAtomicReference

The following are some considerations you need to know when you use IAtomicReference:

* `IAtomicReference` works based on the byte-content and not on the object-reference.
If you use the `compareAndSet` method, do not change to the original value because its
serialized content will then be different. It is also important to know that if you rely
on Java serialization, sometimes (especially with hashmaps) the same object can result in
different binary content.
* All methods returning an object return a private copy. You can modify the private copy,
but the rest of the world is shielded from your changes. If you want these changes to be
visible to the rest of the world, you need to write the change back to the `IAtomicReference`;
but be careful about introducing a data-race.
* The 'in-memory format' of an `IAtomicReference` is `binary`. The receiving side does
not need to have the class definition available unless it needs to be deserialized on the
other side, e.g., because a method like 'alter' is executed. This deserialization is done
for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary content, so be careful
with expensive object graphs that need to be deserialized.
* If you have an object with many fields or an object graph and you only need to calculate
some information or need a subset of fields, you can use the `apply` method. With the `apply`
method, the whole object does not need to be sent over the line; only the information that is
relevant is sent.
