= Topic
[[topic]]

Hazelcast provides a distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. This is
also known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publishing and subscribing operations are cluster wide.
When a member subscribes to a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster,
including the new members that joined after you add the listener.

NOTE: Publish operation is async. It does not wait for operations to run in
remote members; it works as fire and forget.

[[getting-a-topic-and-publishing-messages]]
== Getting a Topic and Publishing Messages

Use the HazelcastInstance's `getTopic` method to get the topic, then use the topic's
`publish` method to publish your messages. The following is an example publisher:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicPublisher.java[tag=tp]
----

And here is an example subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicSubscriber.java[tag=tsub]
----

Hazelcast Topic uses the `MessageListener` interface to listen for events that occur
when a message is received. See the xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-topic-messages[Listening for Topic Messages section]
for information on how to create a message listener class and register it.

[[getting-topic-statistics]]
== Getting Topic Statistics

Topic has two statistic variables that you can query. These values are incremental and local to the member.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicStats.java[tag=ts]
----

`getPublishOperationCount` and `getReceiveOperationCount` returns the total
number of published and received messages since the start of this member, respectively.
Note that these values are not backed up, so if the member goes down, these values will be lost.

You can disable this feature with topic configuration. See the <<configuring-topic, Configuring Topic section>>.

NOTE: These statistics values can be also viewed in Management Center. See the
xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-dds.adoc#monitoring-topics[Monitoring Topics section]
in Hazelcast Management Center documentation.

[[understanding-topic-behavior]]
== Understanding Topic Behavior

Each cluster member has a list of all registrations in the cluster.
When a new member is registered for a topic, it sends a registration message
to all members in the cluster. Also, when a new member joins the cluster, it
receives all registrations made so far in the cluster.

The behavior of a topic varies depending on the value of the configuration
parameter `globalOrderEnabled`.

[[ordering-messages-as-published]]
=== Ordering Messages as Published

If `globalOrderEnabled` is disabled, messages are not ordered and listeners
(subscribers) process the messages in the order that the messages are published.
If cluster member M publishes messages *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* to a topic **T**,
then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic **T** receive and
process *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* in the given order.

Here is how it works: Let's say that we have three members (*member1*, *member2* and
*member3*) and that *member1* and *member2* are registered to a topic named `news`.
Note that all three members know that *member1* and *member2* are registered to `news`.

In this example, *member1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. *Member3* publishes
two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When *member1* and *member3* publish a message, they check
their local list for registered members, discover that *member1* and *member2* are
in their lists, and then they fire messages to those members. One possible order of
the messages received could be the following.

*member1* -> `c1`, `a1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* -> `c1`, `c2`, `a1`, `a2`

[[ordering-messages-for-members]]
=== Ordering Messages for Members

If `globalOrderEnabled` is enabled, all members listening to the same topic
get its messages in the same order.

Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three members (*member1*, *member2* and
*member3*) and that *member1* and *member2* are registered to a topic named `news`.
Note that all three members know that *member1* and *member2* are registered to `news`.

In this example, *member1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. *Member3* publishes
two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When a member publishes messages over the topic `news`,
it first calculates which partition the `news` ID corresponds to. Then it sends an
operation to the owner of the partition for that member to publish messages. Let's assume
that `news` corresponds to a partition that *member2* owns. *member1* and *member3* first
sends all messages to *member2*. Assume that the messages are published in the following order:

*member1* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* then publishes these messages by looking at registrations in its local list.
It sends these messages to *member1* and *member2* (it makes a local dispatch for itself).

*member1* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

This way we guarantee that all members see the events in the same order.

[[keeping-generated-and-published-order-the-same]]
=== Keeping Generated and Published Order the Same

In both cases, there is a `StripedExecutor` in EventService that is responsible for
dispatching the received message. For all events in Hazelcast, the order that events
are generated and the order they are published to the user are guaranteed to be the
same via this `StripedExecutor`.

In `StripedExecutor`, there are as many threads as are specified in the property
`hazelcast.event.thread.count` (default is five). For a specific event source (for a
particular topic name), *hash of that source's name % 5* gives the ID of the responsible
thread. Note that there can be another event source (entry listener of a map, item listener
of a collection, etc.) corresponding to the same thread. In order not to make other messages
to block, heavy processing should not be done in this thread. If there is time-consuming work
that needs to be done, the work should be handed over to another thread. See the
<<getting-a-topic-and-publishing-messages, Getting a Topic and Publishing Messages section>>.

[[configuring-topic]]
== Configuring Topic

To configure a topic, set the topic name, decide on statistics and global ordering,
and set the message listeners.
The following are the default values:

* `global-ordering` is **false**, meaning that by default, there is no guarantee of global order.
* `statistics` is **true**, meaning that by default, statistics are calculated.

You can see the example configuration snippets below.

**Programmatic Configuration:**

Topic configuration has the following elements:

* `statistics-enabled`: Specifies whether the statistics gathering is enabled for your topic.
If set to `false`, you cannot collect statistics in your implementation
(using `getLocalTopicStats()`) and also
xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-dds.adoc#monitoring-topics[Hazelcast Management Center]
will not show them. Its default value is `true`.
* `global-ordering-enabled`: Default is `false`, meaning there is no global order guarantee.
* `message-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the topic messages.

Besides the above elements, there are the following system properties
that are topic related but not topic specific:

* `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity` with a default value of 1,000,000
* `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis` with a default value of 250
* `hazelcast.event.thread.count` with a default value of 5

For the descriptions of these parameters, see the xref:events:global-event-configuration.adoc[Global Event Configuration section].
