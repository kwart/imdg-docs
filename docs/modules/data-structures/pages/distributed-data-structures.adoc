= Distributed Data Structures
[[distributed-data-structures]]

As mentioned in the xref:overview:hazelcast-overview.adoc[Overview section], Hazelcast offers
distributed implementations of many common data structures. For each of the client
languages, Hazelcast mimics as closely as possible the natural interface of the
structure. So, for example in Java, the map follows `java.util.Map` semantics.
In the descriptions below, we mention each structure's Java equivalent interface.  All of
these structures are usable from Java, .NET, C++, Node.js, Python, and Go.

* **Standard utility collections**
** xref:map.adoc[Map] is the distributed implementation of `java.util.Map`.
It lets you read from and write to a Hazelcast map with methods such as
`get` and `put`.
** xref:queue.adoc[Queue] is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`.
You can add an item in one member and remove it from another one.
** xref:ringbuffer.adoc[Ringbuffer] is implemented for reliable eventing system.
** xref:set.adoc[Set] is the distributed and concurrent implementation of `java.util.Set`.
It does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve their order.
** xref:list.adoc[List] is similar to Hazelcast Set. The only difference is that it allows
duplicate elements and preserves their order.
** xref:multimap.adoc[Multimap] is a specialized Hazelcast map. It is a distributed data
structure where you can store multiple values for a single key.
** xref:replicated-map.adoc[Replicated Map] does not partition data. It does not spread
data to different cluster members. Instead, it replicates the data to all members.
** xref:cardinality-estimator-service.adoc[Cardinality Estimator] is a data structure which implements
Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm.
* **Topic**
** xref:topic.adoc[Topic] is the distributed mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. It is also known as the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model.
** xref:reliable-topic.adoc[Reliable Topic] uses the same interface as Hazelcast Topic, except it is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure.
* **Concurrency utilities**
** xref:lock.adoc[Lock] is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`.
When you use lock, the critical section that Hazelcast Lock guards is guaranteed to be
executed by only one thread in the entire cluster.
** xref:isemaphore.adoc[ISemaphore] is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`.
When performing concurrent activities, semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts.
** xref:iatomiclong.adoc[IAtomicLong] is the distributed implementation of
`java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong`. Most of AtomicLong's operations are available.
However, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from
AtomicLong, due to being distributed.
** xref:iatomicreference.adoc[IAtomicReference] is the distributed implementation of
`java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`. When you need to deal with a reference
in a distributed environment, you can use Hazelcast IAtomicReference.
** xref:id-generator.adoc[IdGenerator] is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers.
** xref:icountdownlatch.adoc[ICountdownLatch] is the distributed implementation of
`java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`. Hazelcast CountDownLatch is a gate keeper for
concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete
their operations.
** xref:pn-counter.adoc[PN counter] is a distributed data structure where each Hazelcast instance
can increment and decrement the counter value and these updates are propagated to all replicas.
* xref:event-journal.adoc[Event Journal] is a distributed data structure that stores the history of mutation actions on map or cache.
