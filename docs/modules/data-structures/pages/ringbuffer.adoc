[[ringbuffer]]

Hazelcast Ringbuffer is a replicated but not partitioned data structure that
stores its data in a ring-like structure. You can
think of it as a circular array with a given capacity. Each Ringbuffer has a
tail and a head. The tail is where the items are
added and the head is where the items are overwritten or expired. You can reach
each element in a Ringbuffer using a sequence
ID, which is mapped to the elements between the head and tail (inclusive) of the Ringbuffer.

[[getting-a-ringbuffer-and-reading-items]]
== Getting a Ringbuffer and Reading Items

Reading from Ringbuffer is simple: get the Ringbuffer with the
HazelcastInstance `getRingbuffer` method, get its current head with
the `headSequence` method and start reading. Use the method `readOne` to
return the item at the
given sequence; `readOne` blocks if no item is available. To read the next item,
increment the sequence by one.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/ExampleRB.java[tag=rb]
----

By exposing the sequence, you can now move the item from the Ringbuffer
as long as the item is still available. If the item is not available
any longer, `StaleSequenceException` is thrown.

[[adding-items-to-a-ringbuffer]]
== Adding Items to a Ringbuffer

Adding an item to a Ringbuffer is also easy with the Ringbuffer `add` method:

[source,java]
----
Ringbuffer<String> ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer("ExampleRB");
ringbuffer.add("someitem");
----

Use the method `add` to return the sequence of the inserted item; the
sequence value is always unique. You can use this as a
very cheap way of generating unique IDs if you are already using Ringbuffer.

[[iqueue-vs-ringbuffer]]
== IQueue vs. Ringbuffer

Hazelcast Ringbuffer can sometimes be a better alternative than an
Hazelcast IQueue. Unlike IQueue, Ringbuffer does not remove the items, it only
reads items using a certain position. There are many advantages to this
approach as described below:

* The same item can be read multiple times by the same thread. This is
useful for realizing semantics of read-at-least-once or
read-at-most-once.
* The same item can be read by multiple threads. Normally you could use an
IQueue per thread for the same semantic, but this is
less efficient because of the increased remoting. A take from an IQueue is
destructive, so the change needs to be applied for backup
also, which is why a `queue.take()` is more expensive than a `ringBuffer.read(...)`.
* Reads are extremely cheap since there is no change in the Ringbuffer.
Therefore no replication is required.
* Reads and writes can be batched to speed up performance. Batching can
dramatically improve the performance of Ringbuffer.

[[configuring-ringbuffer-capacity]]
== Configuring Ringbuffer Capacity

By default, a Ringbuffer is configured with a `capacity` of 10000 items.
This creates an array with a size of 10000. If
a `time-to-live` is configured, then an array of longs is also created that
stores the expiration time for every item.
In a lot of cases you may want to change this `capacity` number to something
that better fits your needs.

Below is a declarative configuration example of a Ringbuffer with a `capacity` of 2000 items.

Currently, Hazelcast Ringbuffer is not a partitioned data structure;
its data is stored in a single partition and the replicas
 are stored in another partition. Therefore, create a Ringbuffer that can
safely fit in a single cluster member.

[[backing-up-ringbuffer]]
== Backing Up Ringbuffer

Hazelcast Ringbuffer has a single synchronous backup by default. You can control
the Ringbuffer backup just like most of the other Hazelcast
distributed data structures by setting the synchronous and asynchronous backups:
`backup-count` and `async-backup-count`. In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with no
synchronous backups and one asynchronous backup:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <ringbuffer name="rb">
        <backup-count>0</backup-count>
        <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
    </ringbuffer>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  ringbuffer:
    rb:
      backup-count: 0
      async-backup-count: 1
----
====

An asynchronous backup probably gives you better performance. However, there
is a chance that the item added will be lost
when the member owning the primary crashes before the backup could complete.
You may want to consider batching
methods if you need high performance but do not want to give up on consistency.

[[configuring-ringbuffer-time-to-live]]
== Configuring Ringbuffer Time-To-Live

You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with a time-to-live in seconds. Using
this setting, you can control how long the items remain in
the Ringbuffer before they are expired. By default, the time-to-live is set to 0,
meaning that unless the item is overwritten,
it will remain in the Ringbuffer indefinitely. If you set a time-to-live and an item
is added, then, depending on the Overflow Policy,
either the oldest item is overwritten, or the call is rejected.

In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with a time-to-live of 180 seconds.

[[setting-ringbuffer-overflow-policy]]
== Setting Ringbuffer Overflow Policy

Using the overflow policy, you can determine what to do if the oldest item
in the Ringbuffer is not old enough to expire when
 more items than the configured Ringbuffer capacity are being added. The below
options are currently available:

* `OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE`: The oldest item is overwritten.
* `OverflowPolicy.FAIL`: The call is aborted. The methods that make use of the
OverflowPolicy return `-1` to indicate that adding
the item has failed.

Overflow policy gives you fine control on what to do if the Ringbuffer is full.
You can also use the overflow policy to apply
a back pressure mechanism. The following example code shows the usage of an exponential backoff.

[[ringbuffer-with-persistent-datastore]]
== Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the Ringbuffer items from/to a persistent
datastore using the interface `RingbufferStore`. If a Ringbuffer store is enabled,
each item added to the Ringbuffer will also be stored at the configured Ringbuffer store.

If the Ringbuffer store is configured, you can get items with sequences which are
no longer in the actual Ringbuffer but are only in the Ringbuffer store. This is
probably much slower but still allows you to continue consuming items from the
Ringbuffer even if they are overwritten with newer items in the Ringbuffer.

When a Ringbuffer is being instantiated, it checks if the Ringbuffer store is
configured and requests the latest sequence in the Ringbuffer store. This is to
enable the Ringbuffer to start with sequences larger than the ones in the Ringbuffer
store. In this case, the Ringbuffer is empty but you can still request older items
from it (which will be loaded from the Ringbuffer store).

The Ringbuffer store stores items in the same format as the Ringbuffer. If the
`BINARY` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface
`RingbufferStore<byte[]>` meaning that the Ringbuffer receives items in the binary format.
If the `OBJECT` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface
`RingbufferStore<K>`, where `K` is the type of item being stored (meaning that the Ringbuffer
store receives the deserialized object).

When adding items to the Ringbuffer, the method `storeAll` allows you to store items in batches.

The following example class includes all of the `RingbufferStore` methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/TheRingbufferObjectStore.java[tag=rbstore]
----

`Item` must be serializable. The following is an example of a Ringbuffer with the
Ringbuffer store configured and enabled.

The following are the explanations for the Ringbuffer store configuration elements:

* `class-name: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.
* `factory-class-name`: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStoreFactory` interface. This interface allows a factory class to be registered instead of a class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.

Either the `class-name` or the `factory-class-name` element should be used.

[[configuring-ringbuffer-in-memory-format]]
== Configuring Ringbuffer In-Memory Format

You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with an in-memory format that controls the
format of the Ringbuffer's stored items. By default, `BINARY` in-memory format is used,
meaning that the object is stored in a serialized form. You can select the `OBJECT` in-memory
format, which is useful when filtering is
applied or when the `OBJECT` in-memory format has a smaller memory footprint than `BINARY`.

In the declarative configuration example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with the
`OBJECT` in-memory format:

[[configuring-split-brain-protection-for-ringbuffer]]
== Configuring Split-Brain Protection for Ringbuffer

Ringbuffer can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying Ringbuffer operations. This is a check to avoid performing successful Ringbuffer operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition and can be configured using the element `quorum-ref`. You should set this element's value as the quorum's name, which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section]. Following is an example snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <ringbuffer name="rb">
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </ringbuffer>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The following is a list of methods, grouped by quorum type, that support split-brain protection checks:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `addAllAsync`
** `addAsync`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `capacity`
** `headSequence`
** `readManyAsync`
** `readOne`
** `remainingCapacity`
** `size`
** `tailSequence`

[[adding-batched-items]]
== Adding Batched Items

In the previous examples, the method `ringBuffer.add()` is used to add an item to the Ringbuffer.
The problems with this method
are that it always overwrites and that it does not support batching. Batching can have a huge
impact on the performance. You can use the method `addAllAsync` to support batching.

See the following example code.

[source,java]
----
List<String> items = Arrays.asList("1","2","3");
CompletionStage<Long> s = rb.addAllAsync(items, OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE);
// block until all items are added
s.toCompletableFuture().join();
----

In the above case, three strings are added to the Ringbuffer using the policy
`OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE`. See the <<setting-ringbuffer-overflow-policy, Overflow Policy section>> for more information.

[[reading-batched-items]]
== Reading Batched Items

In the previous example, the `readOne` method read items from the Ringbuffer.
`readOne` is simple but not very efficient for the following reasons:

* `readOne` does not use batching.
* `readOne` cannot filter items at the source; the items need to be retrieved
before being filtered.

The method `readManyAsync` can read a batch of items and can filter items at the source.

See the following example code.

[source,java]
----
CompletionStage<ReadResultSet<E>> readManyAsync(
    long startSequence,
    int minCount,
    int maxCount,
    IFunction<E, Boolean> filter);
----

The meanings of the `readManyAsync` arguments are given below:

* `startSequence`: Sequence of the first item to read.
* `minCount`: Minimum number of items to read. If you do not want to block,
set it to 0. If you want to block for at least one item,
set it to 1.
* `maxCount`: Maximum number of the items to retrieve. Its value cannot exceed 1000.
* `filter`: A function that accepts an item and checks if it should be returned.
If no filtering should be applied, set it to `null`.

A full example is given below.

[source,java]
----
long sequence = rb.headSequence();
for(;;) {
    CompletionStage<ReadResultSet<String>> f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, 1, 10, null);
    CompletionStage<Integer> readCountStage = f.thenApplyAsync(rs -> {
        for (String s : rs) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
        return rs.readCount();
    });
    sequence += readCountStage.toCompletableFuture().join();
}
----

Please take a careful look at how your sequence is being incremented. You cannot
always rely on the number of items being returned
if the items are filtered out.

There is not any filtering applied in the above example. The following example shows
how you can apply a filter when reading batched items. First, let's create our filter
as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class FruitFilter implements IFunction<String, Boolean> {
    public FruitFilter() {}

    public Boolean apply(String s) {
        return s.startsWith("a");
    }
}
----

So, the `FruitFilter` checks whether a String object starts with the letter "a".
You can see this filter in action in the below example:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Ringbuffer<String> rb = hz.getRingbuffer("rb");

rb.add("apple");
rb.add("orange");
rb.add("pear");
rb.add("peach");
rb.add("avocado");

long sequence = rb.headSequence();
CompletableFuture<ReadResultSet<String>> f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, 2, 5, new FruitFilter()).toCompletableFuture();

ReadResultSet<String> rs = f.join();
for (String s : rs) {
    System.out.println(s);
}
----

[[using-async-methods]]
== Using Async Methods

Hazelcast Ringbuffer provides asynchronous methods for more powerful operations
like batched writing or batched reading with filtering.
To wait for the result of the operation in a blocking way, obtain a `CompletableFuture`
from the returned `CompletionStage` by invoking `CompletionStage#toCompletableFuture()` method, then
use either `CompletableFuture#get()` or `CompletableFuture#join()`.

See the following example code.

[source,java]
----
ICompletableFuture f = ringbuffer.addAsync(item, OverflowPolicy.FAIL);
f.get();
----

However, you can also use `ICompletableFuture` to get notified when the operation has completed. The advantage of `ICompletableFuture` is that the thread used for the call is not blocked till the response is returned.

See the below code as an example of when you want to
get notified when a batch of reads has completed.

[source,java]
----
ICompletableFuture<ReadResultSet<String>> f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, min, max, someFilter);
f.andThen(new ExecutionCallback<ReadResultSet<String>>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(ReadResultSet<String> response) {
         for (String s : response) {
             System.out.println("Received:" + s);
         }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
        t.printStackTrace();
    }
});
