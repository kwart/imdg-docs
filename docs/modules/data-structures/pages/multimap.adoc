[[multimap]]

Hazelcast `MultiMap` is a specialized map where you can store multiple values
under a single key. Just like any other distributed data structure implementation in
Hazelcast, `MultiMap` is distributed and thread-safe.

Hazelcast `MultiMap` is not an implementation of `java.util.Map` due to the difference
in method signatures. It supports most features of Hazelcast Map except for indexing,
predicates and MapLoader/MapStore. The entries are almost evenly
distributed onto all cluster members. However, this distribution is based on the entry keys:
if there are multiple entries having the same key but different values,
such entries are stored on the same member, otherwise they are distributed among the members.
When a new member joins the cluster, the same
ownership logic used in the distributed map applies.

== Getting a MultiMap and Putting an Entry

The following example creates a MultiMap and puts items into it:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/multimap/ExampleMultiMap.java[tag=mm]
----

We use the `getMultiMap` method to create the MultiMap and then use the `put`
method to put an entry into it.

Now let's print the entries in this MultiMap using the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/multimap/PrintMember.java[tag=pm]
----

After you run `ExampleMultiMap`, run `PrintMember`. You will see the key **`a`** has
two values, as shown below:

`b -> [3]`

`a -> [2, 1]`

Hazelcast MultiMap uses `EntryListener` to listen to events which occur when
entries are added to, updated in or removed from the MultiMap. See the
xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-multimap-events[Listening for MultiMap Events section]
for information on how to create an entry listener class and register it.

[[configuring-multimap]]
== Configuring MultiMap

When using MultiMap, the collection type of the values can be either **Set** or **List**.
Configure the collection type with the `valueCollectionType` parameter. If you choose
`Set`, duplicate and null values are not allowed in your collection and ordering is irrelevant.
If you choose `List`, ordering is relevant and your collection can include duplicate but not null values.

You can also enable statistics for your MultiMap with the `statisticsEnabled` parameter.
If you enable `statisticsEnabled`, statistics can be retrieved with `getLocalMultiMapStats()` method.


NOTE: Currently, eviction is not supported for the MultiMap data structure.


The following are the example MultiMap configurations.

**Declarative Configuration:**

**Declarative Configuration:**

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <multimap name="default">
        <backup-count>0</backup-count>
        <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
        <value-collection-type>SET</value-collection-type>
        <entry-listeners>
            <entry-listener include-value="false" local="false" >com.hazelcast.examples.EntryListener</entry-listener>
        </entry-listeners>
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </multimap>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/multimap/MultiMapConfiguration.java[tag=mmc]
----


The following are the configuration elements and their descriptions:

* `backup-count`: Defines the number of synchronous backups. For example,
if it is set to 1, backup of a partition will be
placed on one other member. If it is 2, it will be placed on two other members.
* `async-backup-count`: The number of asynchronous backups. Behavior is the
same as that of the `backup-count` element.
* `statistics-enabled`: Specifies whether the statistics gathering is enabled for your MultiMap.
If set to `false`, you cannot collect statistics in your implementation
(using `getLocalMultiMapStats()`) and also
xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-dds.adoc#monitoring-multimaps[Hazelcast Management Center]
will not show them. Its default value is `true`.
* `value-collection-type`: Type of the value collection. It can be `SET` or `LIST`.
* `entry-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the map entries.
You can also set the attribute
`include-value` to `true` if you want the item event to contain the entry values.
You can set
`local` to `true` if you want to listen to the entries on the local member.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this MultiMap to use.
See the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc#split-brain-protection-for-multimap-and-transactionalmultimap[Split-Brain Protection for MultiMap and TransactionalMultiMap section].

[[split-brain-protection-for-multimap-and-transactionalmultimap]]
== Split-Brain Protection for MultiMap and TransactionalMultiMap

MultiMap & TransactionalMultiMap can be configured to check for a minimum number of
available members before applying their operations (see the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section]).
This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

The following is a list of methods that support split-brain protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

MultiMap:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `clear`
** `forceUnlock`
** `lock`
** `put`
** `remove`
** `tryLock`
** `unlock`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `containsEntry`
** `containsKey`
** `containsValue`
** `entrySet`
** `get`
** `isLocked`
** `keySet`
** `localKeySet`
** `size`
** `valueCount`
** `values`

TransactionalMultiMap:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `put`
** `remove`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `size`
** `get`
** `valueCount`

**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-brain protection for MultiMap can be configured programmatically using
the method https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/MultiMapConfig.html[setSplitBrainProtectionName()^],
or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <multimap name="default">
        <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
    </multimap>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section].
