= FencedLock
[[lock]]

`FencedLock` is a linearizable and distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`, meaning that if you lock using a `FencedLock`, the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly. Also note that Hazelcast Lock does not support fairness.

NOTE: NOTE: `ILock` interface and implementation of `ILock` has been deprecated. To read about `ILock`, see the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11.2/manual/html-single/index.html#lock[Lock] section of the Hazelcast IMDG 3.11 Reference Manual. The xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] introduces `FencedLock` provided.

== Using Try-Catch Blocks with Locks

Always use locks with *try*-*catch* blocks. This ensures that locks are
released if an exception is thrown from
the code in a critical section. Also note that the `lock` method is outside
the *try*-*catch* block because we do not want to unlock
if the lock operation itself fails.

[[releasing-locks-with-trylock-timeout]]
== Releasing Locks with tryLock Timeout

If a lock is not released in the cluster, another thread that is trying to get the
lock can wait forever. To avoid this, use `tryLock` with a timeout value. You can
set a high value (normally it should not take that long) for `tryLock`.
You can check the return value of `tryLock` as follows:

[source,java]
----
if ( lock.tryLock ( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ) {
  try {
    // do some stuff here..
  } finally {
    lock.unlock();
  }
} else {
  // warning
}

== Understanding Lock Behavior

* Locks are fail-safe. If a member holds a lock and some other members go down,
the cluster will keep your locks safe and available.
Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that
dead member will be removed so that those
locks are immediately available for live members.
* Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast
does not automatically perform garbage collection in the lock.
This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create locks on the fly,
make sure they are destroyed.
* Locks are re-entrant. The same thread can lock multiple times on the same lock.
Note that for other threads to be able to require this lock, the owner of the lock
must call `unlock` as many times as the owner called `lock`.
