= Deploying On Amazon EC2
[[deploying-on-amazon-ec2]]

You can deploy your Hazelcast project onto an Amazon EC2 environment using Third Party tools such as https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] and https://www.chef.io/chef/[Chef].

You can find a sample deployment project (`amazon-ec2-vagrant-chef`) with step-by-step instructions in the `hazelcast-integration` folder of the **hazelcast-code-samples** package, which you can download at https://hazelcast.org/download/[hazelcast.org]. See this sample project for more information.
