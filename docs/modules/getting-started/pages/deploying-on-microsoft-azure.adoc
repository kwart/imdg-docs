You can deploy your Hazelcast cluster onto a Microsoft Azure environment. For this, your cluster should make use of Hazelcast Discovery Plugin for Microsoft Azure. You can find information about this plugin on its GitHub repository at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure].

For information on how to automatically deploy your cluster onto Azure, see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure/blob/master/README.md#automated-deployment[Deployment section] of the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure] plugin repository.
