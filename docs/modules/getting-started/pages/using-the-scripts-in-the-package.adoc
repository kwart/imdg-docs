= Using the Scripts In The Package
[[using-the-scripts-in-the-package]]

When you download and extract the Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ package, you will see the following scripts under the `/bin` folder that provide basic functionalities for member and cluster management.

The following are the names and descriptions of each script:

* `start.sh` / `start.bat`: Starts a Hazelcast member with default configuration in the working directory.
* `stop.sh` / `stop.bat`: Stops the Hazelcast member that was started in the current working directory.
* `cluster.sh`: Provides basic functionalities for cluster management, such as getting and changing the cluster state, shutting down the cluster or forcing the cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start. See the xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-script-cluster-sh[Using the Script cluster.sh section] to learn the usage of this script.

NOTE: `start.sh` / `start.bat` scripts lets you start one Hazelcast instance per folder. To start a new instance, please unzip Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ package in a new folder.

NOTE: You can also use the start scripts to deploy your own library to a Hazelcast member. See the xref:clusters:deploying-user-codes-on-the-member.adoc#adding-user-library-to-classpath[Adding User Library to CLASSPATH section].
