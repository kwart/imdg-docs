= Deploying using Docker

You can deploy your Hazelcast projects using the Docker containers. Hazelcast has the following images on Docker:

* Hazelcast IMDG
* Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise
* Hazelcast Management Center
* Hazelcast OpenShift

After you pull an image from the Docker registry, you can run your image to start the Management Center or a Hazelcast instance with Hazelcast's default configuration. All repositories provide the latest stable releases but you can pull a specific release, too. You can also specify environment variables when running the image.

If you want to start a customized Hazelcast instance, you can extend the Hazelcast image by providing your own configuration file.

This feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. See its own GitHub repo at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker[Hazelcast Docker] for details on configurations and usages.
