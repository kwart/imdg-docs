= Quick Start

This section provides information on how you can
start using WAN Replication with a minimal setup for both
xref:modes.adoc#active-passive[Active-Passive] and xref:modes.adoc#active-active[Active-Active] modes.

== Setting Up an Active-Passive Mode

This mode usually requires configuration only on one of the clusters.
Let's say you have two clusters, one in London and the other in Tokyo.
You want to replicate the updates between each other and use the one in Tokyo
as the active cluster.

1 - Add the following configuration example on your cluster in Tokyo:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            <target-endpoints>10.3.5.1:5701</target-endpoints>
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
    </map>

</hazelcast>

YAML::

[source,xml]

hazelcast:
  wan-replication:
    london-wan-rep:
      batch-publisher:
        cluster-name: london
        target-endpoints: 10.3.5.1:5701

    map:
      replicatedMap:
        wan-replication-ref: london-wan-rep

2 - Start your clusters to start using Active-Passive WAN Replication.

Basically, what we did here is defining a WAN Replication configuration (`wan-replication`)
and configuring our map to use it (`wan-replication-ref`). As mentioned, this is the minimal
configuration example, which is fine for most use cases. There are more configuration options for
tuning the WAN Replication; see the xref:tuning.adoc[Tuning WAN Replication section].

In the above example, we have configured the map named `replicatedMap` to
replicate to the target cluster named `london` on a single endpoint, as specified with
the `target-endpoints` element. Notice that the name of `wan-replication`
configuration (`london-wan-rep`) is referenced in
the `map` configuration using the `wan-replication-ref` element; this is how
you make your map to use the WAN Replication feature. For now, only Hazelcast maps
and caches support this feature.

The `london` cluster might have more members than the one specified in this example, but only
that endpoint will receive the WAN events. In that case
and if you want the events to be forwarded to the other cluster members, see the `republishing-enabled`
element description in the xref:configuring-for-map-and-cache.adoc[Configuring for IMap and ICache section].

This example configuration defines a static endpoint to specify the target cluster member, using the `target-endpoints` element or `setTargetEndpoints()` method, respectively.
You can also use Hazelcast's Discovery SPI for WAN Replication to specify endpoints on various
cloud infrastructures. See the xref:defining-wan-replication.adoc#wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi[Using Discovery SPI section].

== Setting Up an Active-Active Mode

Using the above scenario, this mode requires configuration on both clusters.

1 - Add the following configuration example on your cluster in Tokyo:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name>tokyo</cluster-name>
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            <target-endpoints>10.3.5.1:5701</target-endpoints>
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
    </map>

</hazelcast>

  wan-replication:
    london-wan-rep:

        cluster-name: london
        target-endpoints: 10.3.5.1:5701

    map:
      replicatedMap:
        wan-replication-ref: london-wan-rep

2 - Add the following configuration example on your cluster in London:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
    <wan-replication name="tokyo-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>tokyo</cluster-name>
            <target-endpoints>32.1.1.1:5701</target-endpoints>
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="tokyo-wan-rep"/>
    </map>

3 - Start your clusters to start using Active-Active WAN Replication.

Notice the `cluster-name` configuration element (not the one under the `batch-publisher` element, but
the one under the `hazelcast` element).
These are the names specifying the IMDG members' clusters on their locals. So, the name
of the cluster in one location should be mentioned on the cluster in the other location, as shown above.

As in the Active-Passive example shown in the previous section, this example configuration
also uses a static endpoint to specify the target cluster member.
See the xref:defining-wan-replication.adoc#wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi[Using Discovery SPI section] for information
on using the Discovery SPI to specify target members.

As mentioned previously, the above configurations are the minimal ones
to get you started. In case you need to configure some additional aspects of your maps or caches that use WAN Replication, see the xref:configuring-for-map-and-cache.adoc[Configuring for IMap and ICache section].
