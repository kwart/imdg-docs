= Getting Member Statistics

You can get various statistics from your distributed data structures via the Statistics API.
Since the data structures are distributed in the cluster, the Statistics API provides
statistics for the local portion (1/Number of Members in the Cluster) of data on each member.

== Map Statistics

To get local map statistics, use the `getLocalMapStats()` method from the `IMap` interface.
This method returns a `LocalMapStats` object that holds local map statistics.

Below is an example code where the `getLocalMapStats()` method and
the `getOwnedEntryCount()` method get the number of entries owned by this member.

[source,java]

include::{javasource}/management/ExampleLocalMapStats.java[tag=lms]
----

NOTE: Since Hazelcast IMDG 3.8 `getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()` method is
now supported for NATIVE in-memory format as well.

The following are some of the metrics that you can access via the `LocalMapStats` object:

* Number of entries owned by the member (`getOwnedEntryCount()`).
* Number of backup entries held by the member (`getBackupEntryCount()`).
* Number of backups per entry (`getBackupCount()`).
* Memory cost (number of bytes) of owned entries in the member (`getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()`).
* Creation time of the map on the member (`getCreationTime()`).
* Number of hits (reads) of the locally owned entries (`getHits()`).
* Number of get and put operations on the map (`getPutOperationCount()` and
`getGetOperationCount()`).
* Number of queries executed on the map (`getQueryCount()` and `getIndexedQueryCount()`)
(it may be imprecise for queries involving partition predicates (`PartitionPredicate`) on the off-heap storage).

See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/LocalMapStats.html[`LocalMapStats` Javadoc^] to see all the metrics.

== Map Index Statistics

To access map index statistics, if you are using indexes to speed up map queries,
use the `getIndexStats()` method of the `LocalMapStats` interface returned by `IMap.getLocalMapStats()`.

Below is an example where the `getIndexStats()` method is used to examine an average selectivity of index hits:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/management/ExampleLocalIndexStats.java[tag=lis]
----

The following are some of the metrics that you can obtain via the `LocalIndexStats` interface:

* Number of queries and hits into an index (`getQueryCount()` and `getHitCount()`):
Number of hits and queries may differ since a single query may hit the same index more than once.
* Average index hit latency measured in nanoseconds (`getAverageHitLatency()`)
* Average index hit selectivity (`getAverageHitSelectivity`): Returned values are
in the range from 0.0 to 1.0. Values close to 1.0 indicate a high selectivity meaning
the index is efficient; values close to 0.0 indicate a low selectivity meaning
the index efficiency is approaching an efficiency of a simple full scan.
* Number of index insert, update and remove operations (`getInsertCount()`,
`getUpdateCount()` and `getRemoveCount()`).
* Total latencies of insert, update and remove operations (`getTotalInsertLatency()`,
`getTotalUpdateLatency()`, `getTotalRemoveLatency()`):
To compute an average latency divide the returned value by the number of operations of a corresponding type.
* Memory cost of an index (`getMemoryCost()`): For on-heap storages,
this memory cost metric value is a best-effort approximation and
doesn't indicate a precise on-heap memory usage of an index.

See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/query/LocalIndexStats.html[`LocalIndexStats` Javadoc^] to see all the metrics.

To compute an aggregated value of `getAverageHitSelectivity()` for all cluster members,
you can use a simple averaging computation as shown below:

```
(s(1) + s(2) + ... + s(n)) / n
```

In this computation, `s(i)` is an average hit selectivity on the member `i` and
`n` is the total number of cluster members.

A more advanced solution is to compute a weighted average as shown below:

```
(s(1) * h(1) + s(2) * h(2) + ... + s(n) * h(n)) / (h(1) + h(2) + ... + h(n))
```

Here, `s(i)` is an average hit selectivity on the member `i`,
`h(i)` is a hit count (`getHitCount()`) on the member `i` and
`n` is the total number of cluster members.
This more advanced solution may produce more precise results in unstable
dynamic clusters where new members do not have enough statistics accumulated.
The same technique may be applied to the `getAverageHitLatency()` metric.

Accuracy and reliability notes:

* The values returned by `getAverageHitSelectivity()` have an accuracy of around 1% for on-heap storages.
* The values returned by `getQueryCount()` and `getHitCount()` may be
imprecise for queries involving partition predicates (`PartitionPredicate`) on off-heap storage.
* The index statistics may be imprecise after a new cluster member addition or
the existing member removal until enough fresh statistics is accumulated on a new owner of an index or its partition.

== Near Cache Statistics

To get Near Cache statistics, use the `getNearCacheStats()` method from the `LocalMapStats` object.
This method returns a `NearCacheStats` object that holds Near Cache statistics.

Below is an example code where the `getNearCacheStats()` method and
the `getRatio` method from `NearCacheStats` get a Near Cache hit/miss ratio.

* memory cost (number of bytes) of owned entries in the Near Cache (`getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()`)
