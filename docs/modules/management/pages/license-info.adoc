= License Information
[[license-info]]

License information is available through the following Hazelcast APIs.

== JMX

The MBean `HazelcastInstance.LicenseInfo` holds all the relative license
details and can be accessed through Hazelcast's JMX port (if enabled). The
following parameters represent these details:

* `maxNodeCountAllowed`: Maximum members allowed to form a cluster under
the current license.
* `expiryDate`: Expiration date of the current license.
* `typeCode`: Type code of the current license.
* `type`: Type of the current license.
* `ownerEmail`: Email of the current license's owner.
* `companyName`: Company name on the current license.

Following is the list of license ``type``s and ``typeCode``s:

```
MANAGEMENT_CENTER(1, "Management Center"),
ENTERPRISE(0, "Enterprise"),
ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_ONLY(2, "Enterprise only with security"),
ENTERPRISE_HD(3, "Enterprise HD"),
CUSTOM(4, "Custom");
```

== REST

You can access the license details by issuing a `GET` request through the
REST API (if enabled; see the xref:management:rest-endpoint-groups.adoc[Using the REST Endpoint Groups section]) on the `/license` resource, as shown below.

```
curl -v http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/rest/license
```

Its output is similar to the following:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5701 (#0)
> GET /hazelcast/rest/license HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5701
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 165

{"licenseInfo":{"expiryDate":4090168799999,"maxNodeCount":99,"type":3,"companyName":null,"ownerEmail":null,"keyHash":"OsLh4O6vqDuKEq8lOANQuuAaRnmDfJfRPrFSEhA7T3Y="}}
```

[[rest-update-license]]To update the license of a running cluster, you can issue a `POST`
request through the REST API (if enabled; see the xref:management:rest-endpoint-groups.adoc[Using the REST Endpoint Groups section]) on the `/license` as shown below:

```
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&$\{PASSWORD}&${LICENSE}" http://localhost:5001/hazelcast/rest/license
```

NOTE: The request parameters must be properly URL-encoded as described in the xref:clients:rest.adoc[REST Client section].

The above command updates the license on all running Hazelcast members of the cluster.
If successful, the response looks as follows:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 5001 (#0)

> Host: 127.0.0.1:5001
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 164
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{"status":"success","licenseInfo":{"expiryDate":1560380399161,"maxNodeCount":10,
"type":-1,"companyName":"ExampleCompany","ownerEmail":"info@example.com",
"keyHash":"ml/u6waTNQ+T4EWxnDRykJpwBmaV9uj+skZzv0SzDhs="},
"message":"License updated at run time - please make sure to update the license
in the persistent configuration to avoid losing the changes on restart."}
```

As the message in the above example indicates, the license is updated only at runtime.
The persistent configuration of each member needs to be updated manually to ensure that
the license change is not lost on restart. The same message is logged as a warning in
each member's log.

It is only possible to update to a license that expires at the same time or after
the current license. The new license must allow the exact same list of features and
the same number of members.

If, for any reason, updating the license fails on some members (member does not respond,
license is not compatible, etc.), the whole operation fails, leaving the cluster in
a potentially inconsistent state (some members have been switched to the new license
while some have not). It is up to you to resolve this situation manually.

== Logs

Besides the above approaches (JMX and REST) to access the license details,
Hazelcast also starts to log a license information banner into the log files
when the license expiration is approaching.

During the last two months prior to the expiration, this license information
banner is logged daily, as a reminder to renew your license to avoid any
interruptions. Once the expiration is due to a month, the frequency of
logging this banner becomes hourly (instead of daily). Lastly, when the
expiration is due in a week, this banner is printed every 30 minutes.

NOTE: Similar alerts are also present on the Hazelcast Management Center.

The banner has the following format:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
HAZELCAST LICENSE WILL EXPIRE IN 29 DAYS.
Your Hazelcast cluster will stop working after this time.

Your license holder is customer@example-company.com, you should have them contact
our license renewal department, urgently on info@hazelcast.com
or call us on +1 (650) 521-5453

Please quote license id CUSTOM_TEST_KEY

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
```

WARNING: Please pay attention to the license warnings to prevent any possible
interruptions in the operation of your Hazelcast applications.
