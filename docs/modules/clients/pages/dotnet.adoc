= .NET Client
[[net-client]]

You can use the native .NET client to connect to Hazelcast client members.
You need to add `HazelcastClient3x.dll` into your .NET project references.
The API is very similar to the Java native client.

See Hazelcast .NET client's own GitHub https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client[repo^]
for information on configuring and starting the client.
You can also find https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client/tree/master/src/Hazelcast.Net.Examples[code samples^]
for this client in this repo.
