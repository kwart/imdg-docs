= Integrating OpenSSL / BoringSSL

NOTE: You cannot integrate OpenSSL into Hazelcast when xref:encryption.adoc[Hazelcast Encryption]
is enabled.

TLS/SSL in Java is normally provided by the JRE. However, the performance overhead can be
significant; even with AES intrinsics
enabled. If you are using a x86_64 system (Linux, Mac, Windows), Hazelcast supports native
integration for TLS/SSL which can provide significant performance
improvements. There are two supported native TLS/SSL libraries available through
https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[netty-tcnative^] libraries:

* OpenSSL
** dynamically linked
** prerequisites: `libapr`, `openssl` packages installed on your system
* BoringSSL - Google managed fork of the OpenSSL
** statically linked
** easier to get started with
** benefits: reduced code footprint, additional features

The native TLS integration can be used on clients and/or members. For best performance, it
is recommended to install on a client and member and
configure the appropriate cipher suite(s).

Check the https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[netty-tcnative^] page
for installation details.

NOTE: If the Java version is
less than 11 and OpenSSL capabilities are detected
(also the appropriate Java libraries are included) and if no
explicit `SSLEngineFactory` is set, Hazelcast IMDG defaults to use OpenSSL.

== Netty Libraries

For the native TLS/SSL integration in Java, the https://netty.io/[Netty^] library is used.

Make sure the following libraries from the Netty framework are on the classpath:

* `netty-handler` and its dependencies
* one of `tc-native` implementations
** either BoringSSL: `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static-\{tcnative_version}.jar`
** or OpenSSL: `netty-tcnative-\{tcnative_version}-\{os_arch}.jar`

NOTE: It is very important that the version of Netty JAR(s) corresponds to
a very specific version of `netty-tcnative`. In case of doubt, the
simplest thing to do is to download the `netty-<version>.tar.bz2` file
from the https://netty.io/downloads.html[Netty^] website and check which
`netty-tcnative` version is used for that Netty release.

== Using BoringSSL

The statically linked BoringSSL binaries are included within the `netty-tcnative`
libraries. There is no need to install additional software on supported systems.

== Using OpenSSL

. Install OpenSSL. Make sure that you are installing 1.0.1 or newer release.
See its documentation at
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md[github.com/openssl^].
. Install Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. See https://apr.apache.org/download.cgi[apr.apache.org^].
+
For RHEL: `sudo yum -y install apr openssl`
+
For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get -y install libapr1 openssl`
+
For Alpine Linux: `apk add --update apr openssl`

Example Maven dependencies (for Linux):

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.netty</groupId>

== Configuring Hazelcast for OpenSSL

Configuring OpenSSL in Hazelcast is straight forward. On the client and/or
member side, the following snippet enables TLS/SSL
using OpenSSL:

            <properties>

hazelcast:
  network:
    ssl:
      enabled: true
      factory-class-name: com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.OpenSSLEngineFactory
      properties:
        protocol: TLSv1.2
        trustCertCollectionFile: trusted-certs.pem

        # If the TLS mutual authentication is not used, following lines (key configuration) are not needed on the client side.
        keyFile: privkey.pem
        keyCertChainFile: chain.pem
----

The configuration is similar to a regular TLS/SSL integration. The main differences
are the `OpenSSLEngineFactory` factory class and the following properties:

* `keyFile`: Path of your PKCS#8 key file in PEM format.
* `keyPassword`: Password to access the key file when it's encrypted.
* `keyCertChainFile`: Path to an X.509 certificate chain file in PEM format.
* `trustCertCollectionFile`: Path to an X.509 certificate collection file in PEM format.
* `fipsMode`: Boolean flag to switch OpenSSL into the FIPS mode. See the xref:security:fips-140-2.adoc[FIPS 140-2 section].

The key and certificate related properties take precedence over keyStore and
trustStore configurations.
Using keyStores and trustStores together with OpenSSL causes problems on some
Java versions, therefore we recommend to use the OpenSSL native way.

The following are the other supported properties:

* `keyStore`: Path of your keystore file.
** _Using the `keyStore` property is not recommended, use `keyFile` and
`keyCertChainFile` instead_
* `keyStorePassword`: Password to access the key from your keystore file.
* `keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default value is `JKS`. Another
commonly used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend
on your Operating system and the Java runtime.
* `keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided.
* `trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the trust managers
are provided.
* `trustStore`: Path of your truststore file. The file truststore is a keystore file
that contains a collection of certificates
 trusted by your application. Its type should be `JKS`.
 ** _Using the `trustStore` property is not recommended, use `trustCertCollectionFile` instead_
* `trustStorePassword`: Password to unlock the truststore file.
* `trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default value is `JKS`. Another
commonly used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend on
your operating system and the Java runtime.
* `ciphersuites`: Comma-separated list of cipher suite names allowed to be used.
* `protocol`: Name of the algorithm which is used in your TLS/SSL. Its default
value is `TLSv1.2`. Available values are:
** `TLS`
** `TLSv1`
** `TLSv1.1`
** `TLSv1.2`
** `SSL` _(insecure!)_
** `SSLv2` _(insecure!)_
** `SSLv3` _(insecure!)_
+
All of the algorithms listed above support Java 8 and higher versions. For the `protocol` property, we recommend you to provide SSL or TLS with its version information, e.g., `TLSv1.2`. Note that if you
provide only `SSL` or `TLS` as a value for the `protocol` property, they are converted to `SSLv3` and `TLSv1.2`, respectively. We strongly recommend to avoid SSL protocols.
