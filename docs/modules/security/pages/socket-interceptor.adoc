= Socket Interceptor

Hazelcast allows you to intercept socket connections before a member
joins a cluster or a client connects to a member of a cluster.
This allow you to add custom hooks to join and perform connection
procedures (like identity checking using a
custom network authentication protocol, etc.).

To use the socket interceptor, implement `com.hazelcast.nio.MemberSocketInterceptor`
for members and `com.hazelcast.nio.SocketInterceptor` for clients.

The following is an example socket interceptor implementation for the member side.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/security/SocketInterceptorMember.java[tag=msi]

You can declaratively configure this socket interceptor as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <socket-interceptor enabled="true">
            <class-name>com.hazelcast.examples.MySocketInterceptor</class-name>
            <properties>
                <property name="kerberos-host">kerb-host-name</property>
                <property name="kerberos-config-file">kerb.conf</property>
            </properties>
        </socket-interceptor>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>

The following is an example configuration of the above socket
interceptor for the client side.
