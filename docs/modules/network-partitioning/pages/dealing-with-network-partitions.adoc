= Dealing with Network Partitions

Hazelcast handles network partitions using the following solutions:

* Split-brain protection: Split-brain protection could be used when
consistency is the major concern on a network partitioning.
It requires a minimum cluster size to keep a particular data structure available.
When cluster size is below the defined split-brain protection size,
then subsequent operations are rejected with a `SplitBrainProtectionException`.
See the xref:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section].
* Split-brain recovery (merge policies): Split-brain recovery is to
make data structures available and operational on both sides of a network partition,
and merge their data once the network partitioning problem is resolved.
See the xref:split-brain-recovery.adoc[Split-Brain Recovery section].

NOTE: Split-brain recovery is also supported for
the data structures whose in-memory format is `NATIVE`.
