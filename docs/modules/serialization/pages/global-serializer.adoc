= Global Serializer

The global serializer is identical to
xref:custom-serialization.adoc[custom serializers] from the implementation perspective.
The global serializer is registered as a fallback serializer to handle all other objects if a serializer cannot be located for them.

By default, the global serializer does not handle `java.io.Serializable` and `java.io.Externalizable` instances.
However, you can configure it to be responsible for those instances.

A custom serializer should be registered for a specific class type.
The global serializer handles all class types if all the steps in searching for
a serializer fail as described in xref:interface-types.adoc[Serialization Interface Types].

The following are some use cases:

* Third party serialization frameworks can be integrated using the global serializer.
* For your custom objects, you can implement a single serializer to handle all of them.
* You can replace the internal Java serialization by enabling the
`overrideJavaSerialization` option of the global serializer configuration.

Any custom serializer can be used as the global serializer.
See the xref:custom-serialization.adoc[Custom Serialization section] for implementation details.

NOTE: To function properly, Hazelcast needs the Java serializable objects to be handled correctly.
If the global serializer is configured to handle the Java serialization, the global serializer must
properly serialize/deserialize the `java.io.Serializable` instances. Otherwise, it causes Hazelcast to malfunction.

== Example Global Serializer

An example global serializer that integrates with a third party serializer is shown below.

[source,java]
----
public class GlobalStreamSerializer
    implements StreamSerializer<Object> {

    private SomeThirdPartySerializer someThirdPartySerializer;

    private init() {
        //someThirdPartySerializer  = ...
    }

    @Override
    public int getTypeId () {
        return 123;
    }

    @Override
    public void write( ObjectDataOutput out, Object object ) throws IOException {
        byte[] bytes = someThirdPartySerializer.encode(object);
        out.writeByteArray(bytes);
    }

    @Override
    public Object read( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {
        byte[] bytes = in.readByteArray();
        return someThirdPartySerializer.decode(bytes);
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy () {
        someThirdPartySerializer.destroy();
    }
}

Now, we can register the global serializer in the configuration file `hazelcast.xml/yaml`, as shown below.
