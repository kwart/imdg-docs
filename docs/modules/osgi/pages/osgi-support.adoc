= OSGI Support

Hazelcast bundles provide OSGI services so that Hazelcast users can
manage (create, access, shutdown) Hazelcast instances through these services on OSGI environments.
When you enable the property `hazelcast.osgi.start` (default is disabled), when
an Hazelcast OSGI service is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically.

Created Hazelcast instances can be served as an OSGI service that the other Hazelcast bundles can access.
Registering created Hazelcast instances behavior is enabled by default;
you can disable it using the property `hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled`.

Each Hazelcast bundle provides a different OSGI service.
Their instances can be grouped (clustered) together to prevent possible compatibility issues between
different Hazelcast versions/bundles. This grouping behavior is enabled by default and
you disable it using the property `hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled`.

Hazelcast OSGI service's lifecycle (and the owned/created instances's lifecycles) is the same with
the owner Hazelcast bundles. When the bundle is stopped (deactivated), the owned service and
Hazelcast instances are also deactivated/shutdown and deregistered automatically.
When the bundle is re-activated, its service is registered again.

The Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise JAR package is also an OSGI bundle like the Hazelcast Open Source JAR package.
