**`HazelcastOSGiService`:** Contract point for Hazelcast services on top of OSGI.
Registered to `org.osgi.framework.BundleContext` as the OSGI service so the other bundles can
access and use Hazelcast on the OSGI environment through this service.

**`HazelcastOSGiInstance`:** Contract point for `HazelcastInstance` implementations based on OSGI service.
`HazelcastOSGiService` provides proxy Hazelcast instances typed `HazelcastOSGiInstance` which is
a subtype of `HazelcastInstance` and these instances delegate all calls to the underlying `HazelcastInstance`.
