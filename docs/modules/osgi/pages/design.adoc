`HazelcastOSGiService` is specific to each Hazelcast bundle. This means that
every Hazelcast bundle has its own `HazelcastOSGiService` instance.

Every Hazelcast bundle registers its `HazelcastOSGiService` instances via
Hazelcast Bundle Activator (`com.hazelcast.osgi.impl.Activator`) while they are being started,
and it deregisters its `HazelcastOSGiService` instances while they are being stopped.

Each `HazelcastOSGiService` instance has a different service ID as the combination of
Hazelcast version and artifact type (`OSS` or `EE`). Examples are `3.6#OSS`, `3.6#EE`, `3.7#OSS`, `3.7#EE`, etc.

`HazelcastOSGiService` instance lifecycle is the same with the owner Hazelcast bundle.
This means that when the owner bundle is deactivated, the owned `HazelcastOSGiService` instance is
deactivated, and all active Hazelcast instances that are created and served by
that `HazelcastOSGiService` instance are also shutdown and deregistered.
When the Hazelcast bundle is re-activated, its `HazelcastOSGiService` instance is registered again as the OSGI service.
