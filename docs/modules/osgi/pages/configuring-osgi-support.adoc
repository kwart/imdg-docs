= Configuring Hazelcast OSGI Support

`HazelcastOSGiService` uses the following configurations:

- **`hazelcast.osgi.start`:** If this property is enabled (it is disabled by default), when an
`HazelcastOSGiService` is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically.
- **`hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled`:** If this property is disabled
(it is disabled by default), when a Hazelcast instance is created by
`HazelcastOSGiService`, the created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is registered automatically as
OSGI service with type of `HazelcastOSGiInstance` and it is deregistered automatically when
the created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is shutdown.
- **`hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled`:** If this property is disabled
(it is disabled by default), every created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is grouped as
their owner `HazelcastOSGiService` and do not join each other unless no cluster name is specified in the `Config`.
