= Using Hazelcast OSGI Service

== Getting Hazelcast OSGI Service Instances

You can access all `HazelcastOSGiService` instances through `org.osgi.framework.BundleContext` for each Hazelcast bundle as follows:

[source,java]
----
for (ServiceReference serviceRef : context.getServiceReferences(HazelcastOSGiService.class.getName(), null)) {
    HazelcastOSGiService service = (HazelcastOSGiService) context.getService(serviceRef);
    String serviceId = service.getId();
    ...
}
----

== Managing and Using Hazelcast instances

You can use `HazelcastOSGiService` instance to create and shutdown Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments.
The created Hazelcast instances are `HazelcastOSGiInstance` typed (which is sub-type of `HazelcastInstance`) and
are just proxies to the underlying Hazelcast instance. There are several methods in `HazelcastOSGiService` to use
Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments as shown below.

[source,java]
----
// Get the default Hazelcast instance owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
// Returns null if `HAZELCAST_OSGI_START` is not enabled
HazelcastOSGiInstance defaultInstance = hazelcastOsgiService.getDefaultHazelcastInstance();


// Creates a new Hazelcast instance with default configurations as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
HazelcastOSGiInstance newInstance1 = hazelcastOsgiService.newHazelcastInstance();


// Creates a new Hazelcast instance with specified configuration as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName("OSGI-Instance");
...
HazelcastOSGiInstance newInstance2 = hazelcastOsgiService.newHazelcastInstance(config);

// Gets the Hazelcast instance with the name `OSGI-Instance`, which is `newInstance2` created above
HazelcastOSGiInstance instance = hazelcastOsgiService.getHazelcastInstanceByName("OSGI-Instance");

// Shuts down the Hazelcast instance with name `OSGI-Instance`, which is `newInstance2`
hazelcastOsgiService.shutdownHazelcastInstance(instance);

// Print all active Hazelcast instances owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
for (HazelcastOSGiInstance instance : hazelcastOsgiService.getAllHazelcastInstances()) {
    System.out.println(instance);
}

// Shuts down all Hazelcast instances owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
hazelcastOsgiService.shutdownAll();
