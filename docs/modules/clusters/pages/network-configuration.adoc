= Other Network Configurations
[[other-network-configurations]]

All network related configurations are performed via the `network` element
in the Hazelcast XML configuration file or the class `NetworkConfig`
when using programmatic configuration. Following subsections describe the
available configurations that you can perform under the `network` element.

[[public-address]]
== Public Address

`public-address` overrides the public address of a member. By default, a member
selects its socket address as its public address. But behind a network address translation (NAT),
two endpoints (members) may not be able to see/access each other.
If both members set their public addresses to their defined addresses on NAT,
then that way they can communicate with each other. In this case, their public addresses
are not an address of a local network interface but a virtual address defined by NAT.
It is optional to set and useful when you have a private cloud.
Note that, the value for this element should be given in the format *`host IP address:port number`*.
See the following examples.

**Declarative Configuration:**

----

config.getNetworkConfig()
    .setPublicAddress( "11.22.33.44:5555" );

[[port]]
== Port

You can specify the ports that Hazelcast uses to communicate between cluster members.
Its default value is `5701`. The following are example configurations.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <port port-count="20" auto-increment="true">5701</port>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    port:
      auto-increment: true
      port-count: 20
      port: 5701
----
====

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.getNetworkConfig().setPort( 5701 )
    .setPortAutoIncrement( true ).setPortCount( 20 );
----

According to the above example, Hazelcast tries to find free ports between 5701 and 5720.

`port` has the following attributes.

* `port-count`: By default, Hazelcast tries 100 ports to bind. Meaning that,
if you set the value of port as 5701, as members are joining to the cluster,
Hazelcast tries to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can choose to change the
port count in the cases like having large instances on a single machine or
willing to have only a few ports to be assigned. The parameter `port-count`
is used for this purpose, whose default value is 100.
* `auto-increment`:  In some cases you may want to choose to use only one port.
In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of `port` by setting
`auto-increment` to `false`. The `port-count` attribute is not used when
auto-increment feature is disabled.

[[outbound-ports]]
== Outbound Ports

By default, Hazelcast lets the system pick up an ephemeral port during socket bind operation.
But security policies/firewalls may require you to restrict outbound ports to be
used by Hazelcast-enabled applications. To fulfill this requirement, you can configure
Hazelcast to use only defined outbound ports. The following are example configurations.


**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs] 
==== 
XML::

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <outbound-ports>
            <!-- ports between 33000 and 35000 -->
            <ports>33000-35000</ports>
            <!-- comma separated ports -->
            <ports>37000,37001,37002,37003</ports>
            <ports>38000,38500-38600</ports>
        </outbound-ports>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    outbound-ports:
      - 33000-35000
      - 37000,37001,37002,37003
      - 38000,38500-38600
----
====

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
...
NetworkConfig networkConfig = config.getNetworkConfig();
// ports between 35000 and 35100
networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition("35000-35100");
// comma separated ports
networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition("36001, 36002, 36003");
networkConfig.addOutboundPort(37000);
networkConfig.addOutboundPort(37001);
...
----

NOTE: You can use port ranges and/or comma separated ports.

As shown in the programmatic configuration, you use the method `addOutboundPort`
to add only one port. If you need to add a group of ports, then use the method `addOutboundPortDefinition`.

In the declarative configuration, the element `ports` can be used for both single and
multiple port definitions. When you set this element to  `0` or  `*`,
your operating system (not Hazelcast) selects a free port from the ephemeral range.

[[reuse-address]]
== Reuse Address

When you shutdown a cluster member, the server socket port goes into the
`TIME_WAIT` state for the next couple of minutes. If you start the member right after
shutting it down, you may not be able to bind it to the same port because it is in the
`TIME_WAIT` state. If you set the `reuse-address` element to `true`, the `TIME_WAIT` state
is ignored and you can bind the member to the same port again.

The following are example configurations.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[[join]]
== Join

The `join` configuration element is used to discover Hazelcast members and enable them
to form a cluster. Hazelcast provides Auto Detection, Multicast, TCP/IP, AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, GCP, Eureka, and more.
These mechanisms are explained the xref:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[Discovery Mechanisms section].
This section describes all the sub-elements and attributes of `join` element.
The following are example configurations.

The `join` element has the following sub-elements and attributes.

[[multicast-element]]
=== multicast element

The `multicast` element includes parameters to fine tune the multicast join mechanism.

* `enabled`: Specifies whether the multicast discovery is enabled or not, `true` or `false`.
* `multicast-group`: The multicast group IP address. Specify it when you want to create
clusters within the same network. Values can be between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255.
Its default value is 224.2.2.3.
* `multicast-port`: The multicast socket port that the Hazelcast member listens to and
sends discovery messages through. Its default value is 54327.
* `multicast-time-to-live`: Time-to-live value for multicast packets sent out to control
the scope of multicasts. See more information, see http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO-2.html[The Linux Documentation Project^].
* `multicast-timeout-seconds`: Only when the members are starting up, this timeout (in seconds)
specifies the period during which a member waits for a multicast response from another member.
For example, if you set it as 60 seconds, each member waits for 60 seconds until a leader
member is selected. Its default value is 2 seconds.
* `trusted-interfaces`: Includes IP addresses of trusted members. When a member wants to
join to the cluster, its join request is rejected if it is not a trusted member. You can
give an IP addresses range using the wildcard (\*) on the last digit of IP address,
e.g., 192.168.1.* or 192.168.1.100-110.

NOTE: If you prefer to use the multicast mechanism, make sure that your network is enclosed and secure. See the xref:discovery-mechanisms.adoc#multicast[Multicast section].

[[tcp-ip-element]]
=== tcp-ip element

The `tcp-ip` element includes parameters to fine tune the TCP/IP join mechanism.

* `enabled`: Specifies whether the TCP/IP discovery is enabled or not.
Values can be `true` or `false`.
* `required-member`: IP address of the required member. Cluster is only
formed if the member with this IP address is found.
* `member`: IP address(es) of one or more well known members. Once members
are connected to these well known ones, all member addresses are communicated
with each other. You can also give comma separated IP addresses using the `members` element.
+
NOTE: `tcp-ip` element also accepts the `interface` parameter. See the
<<interfaces, Interfaces element description>>.
+
* `connection-timeout-seconds`: Defines the connection timeout in seconds.
This is the maximum amount of time Hazelcast is going to try to connect to a well
known member before giving up. Setting it to a too low value could mean that a
member is not able to connect to a cluster. Setting it to a too high value means
that member startup could slow down because of longer timeouts, for example when
a well known member is not up. Increasing this value is recommended if you have many
IPs listed and the members cannot properly build up the cluster. Its default value is 5 seconds.

[[aws-element]]
=== aws element

The `aws` element includes parameters to allow the members to form a cluster on the Amazon EC2 environment.

* `enabled`: Specifies whether the EC2 discovery is enabled or not, `true` or `false`.
* `access-key`, `secret-key`: Access and secret keys of your account on EC2.
* `region`: The region where your members are running. Its default value is `us-east-1`. You need to specify this if the region is other than the default one.
* `host-header`: The URL that is the entry point for a web service. It is optional.
* `security-group-name`: Name of the security group you specified at the EC2 management console. It is used to narrow the Hazelcast members to be within this group. It is optional.
* `tag-key`, `tag-value`: To narrow the members in the cloud down to only Hazelcast members, you can set these parameters as the ones you specified in the EC2 console. They are optional.
* `connection-timeout-seconds`: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, Hazelcast tries to connect to a well known member before giving up. Setting this value too low could mean that a member is not able to connect to a cluster. Setting the value too high means that member startup could slow down because of longer timeouts (for example, when a well known member is not up). Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IPs listed and the members cannot properly build up the cluster. Its default value is 5 seconds.


If you are using a cloud provider other than AWS, you can use the programmatic configuration to specify a TCP/IP cluster. The members need to be retrieved from that provider, e.g., jclouds.

[[discovery-strategies-element]]
=== discovery-strategies element

The `discovery-strategies` element configures internal or external discovery
strategies based on the Hazelcast Discovery SPI. For further information, see
the xref:extending-hazelcast:discovery-spi.adoc[Discovery SPI section] and the vendor documentation of
the used discovery strategy.

[[awsclient-configuration]]
== AWSClient Configuration

To make sure EC2 instances are found correctly, you can use the `AWSClient` class. It determines the private IP addresses of EC2 instances to be connected. Give the `AWSClient` class the values for the parameters that you specified in the `aws` element, as shown below. You will see whether your EC2 instances are found.

[source,java]
----
public static void main( String[] args )throws Exception{
  AwsConfig config = new AwsConfig();
  config.setSecretKey( ... ) ;
  config.setSecretKey( ... );
  config.setRegion( ... );
  config.setSecurityGroupName( ... );
  config.setTagKey( ... );
  config.setTagValue( ... );
  config.setEnabled( true );
  AWSClient client = new AWSClient( config );
  Collection<String> ipAddresses = client.getPrivateIpAddresses();
  System.out.println( "addresses found:" + ipAddresses );
  for ( String ip: ipAddresses ) {
    System.out.println( ip );
  }
}
----

[[interfaces]]
== Interfaces

You can specify which network interfaces that Hazelcast should use.
Servers mostly have more than one network interface, so you may want to list
the valid IPs. **Range characters `"\*"` and `"-"`** can be used for simplicity.
For instance, 10.3.10.* refers to IPs between 10.3.10.0 and 10.3.10.255.
Interface 10.3.10.4-18 refers to IPs between 10.3.10.4 and 10.3.10.18
(4 and 18 included). If network interface configuration is enabled
(it is disabled by default) and if Hazelcast cannot find a matching interface,
then it prints a message on the console and does not start on that member.

The following are example configurations.

----

[[ipv6-support]]
=== IPv6 Support

Hazelcast supports IPv6 addresses seamlessly (This support is switched
off by default, see the note at the end of this section).

All you need is to define IPv6 addresses or interfaces in the network
configuration. The only current limitation is that you cannot define
wildcard IPv6 addresses in the TCP/IP join configuration (`tcp-ip` element).
<<interfaces, Interfaces>> configuration does not have this limitation,
you can configure wildcard IPv6 interfaces in the same way as IPv4 interfaces.

----
====

JVM has two system properties for setting the preferred protocol stack
(IPv4 or IPv6) as well as the preferred address family types (inet4 or inet6).
On a dual stack machine, IPv6 stack is preferred by default, you can change this
through the `java.net.preferIPv4Stack=<true|false>` system property. When querying
name services, JVM prefers IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses and returns an IPv4
address if possible. You can change this through `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=<true|false>`
system property.

See also additional http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/ipv6_guide/[details on IPv6 support in Java^].

NOTE: IPv6 support has been switched off by default, since some platforms have issues
using the IPv6 stack. Some other platforms such as Amazon AWS have no support at all.
To enable IPv6 support, just set configuration property `hazelcast.prefer.ipv4.stack`
to *false*. See the xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] for details.

[[member-address-provides-spi]]
== Member Address Provider SPI

NOTE: This SPI is not intended to provide addresses of other cluster members with
which the Hazelcast instance forms a cluster. To do that, see the
<<other-network-configurations, previous sections>> above.

By default, Hazelcast chooses the public and bind address. You can influence on the
choice by defining a `public-address` in the configuration or by using other
properties mentioned above. In some cases, though, these properties are not
enough and the default address picking strategy chooses wrong addresses.
This may be the case when deploying Hazelcast in some cloud environments,
such as AWS, when using Docker or when the instance is deployed behind a NAT
and the `public-address` property is not enough (see the <<public-address, Public Address section>>).

In these cases, it is possible to configure the bind and public address
in a more advanced way. You can provide an implementation of the
`com.hazelcast.spi.MemberAddressProvider` interface which provides
the bind and public address. The implementation may then choose these
addresses in any way - it may read from a system property or file or
even invoke a web service to retrieve the public and private address.

The details of the implementation depend heavily on the environment in which
Hazelcast is deployed. As such, we now demonstrate how to configure Hazelcast
to use a simplified custom member address provider SPI implementation.
An example implementation is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public static final class SimpleMemberAddressProvider implements MemberAddressProvider {
    @Override
    public InetSocketAddress getBindAddress() {
        // determine the address using some configuration, calling an API, ...
        return new InetSocketAddress(hostname, port);
    }

    @Override
    public InetSocketAddress getPublicAddress() {
        // determine the address using some configuration, calling an API, ...
        return new InetSocketAddress(hostname, port);
    }
}
----

Note that if the bind address port is `0` then it uses a port as configured
in the Hazelcast network configuration (see the <<port, Port section>>).
If the public address port is set to `0` then it broadcasts the same port that
it is bound to. If you wish to bind to any local interface, you may return
`new InetSocketAddress((InetAddress) null, port)` from the `getBindAddress()` address.

The following configuration examples contain properties that are provided to the
constructor of the provider class. If you do not provide any properties, the class
may have either a no-arg constructor or a constructor accepting a single
`java.util.Properties` instance. On the other hand, if you do provide properties
in the configuration, the class must have a constructor accepting a single
`java.util.Properties` instance.
