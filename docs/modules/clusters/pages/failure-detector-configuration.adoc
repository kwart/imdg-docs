= Failure Detector Configuration
[[failure-detector-configuration]]

A failure detector is responsible to determine if a member in the cluster is
unreachable or crashed. The most important problem in failure detection is to
distinguish whether a member is still alive but slow or has crashed. But according
to the famous http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3149.214121[FLP result^],
it is impossible to distinguish a crashed member from a slow one in an asynchronous
system. A workaround to this limitation is to use unreliable failure detectors.
An unreliable failure detector allows a member to suspect that others have failed,
usually based on liveness criteria but it can make mistakes to a certain degree.

Hazelcast has the following built-in failure detectors: Deadline Failure Detector
and Phi Accrual Failure Detector.

There is also a Ping Failure Detector, that, if enabled, works in parallel with
the above ones, but identifies
the failures on OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer). This detector is by default disabled.

Note that, Hazelcast also offers failure detectors for its Java client.
See the xref:clients:java.adoc#java-client-failure-detectors[Client Failure Detectors section] for more information.

== Deadline Failure Detector

_Deadline Failure Detector_ uses an absolute timeout for missing/lost
heartbeats. After timeout, a member is considered as crashed/unavailable
and marked as suspected.

_Deadline Failure Detector_ has the following configuration properties:

* `hazelcast.heartbeat.interval.seconds`: This is the interval at which
member heartbeat messages are sent to each other.
* `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds`: This is the timeout which defines
when a cluster member is suspected because it has not sent any heartbeats.

To use _Deadline Failure Detector_, the configuration property
`hazelcast.heartbeat.failuredetector.type` should be set to `"deadline"`.

NOTE: _Deadline Failure Detector_ is the default failure detector in Hazelcast.

[[phi-accrual-failure-detector]]
== Phi Accrual Failure Detector

This is the failure detector based on
https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/srds/2004/2239/00/22390066-abs.html[The Phi Accrual Failure Detector' by Hayashibara et al.^]

Phi Accrual Failure Detector keeps track of the intervals between heartbeats
in a sliding window of time and measures the mean and variance of these
samples and calculates a value of suspicion level (Phi). The value of phi
increases when the period since the last heartbeat gets longer. If the network
becomes slow or unreliable, the resulting mean and variance increase, there needs
to be a longer period for which no heartbeat is received before the member is suspected. 

The `hazelcast.heartbeat.interval.seconds` and `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds`
properties still can be used as period of heartbeat messages and deadline of
heartbeat messages. Since _Phi Accrual Failure Detector_ is adaptive to network
conditions, a much lower `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds` can be defined than
_Deadline Failure Detector_'s timeout.

In addition to the above two properties, _Phi Accrual Failure Detector_ has the
following configuration properties:

* `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.threshold`: This is the phi
threshold for suspicion. After calculated phi exceeds this threshold, a member
is considered as unreachable and marked as suspected. A low threshold allows to
detect member crashes/failures faster but can generate more mistakes and cause
wrong member suspicions. A high threshold generates fewer mistakes but is slower
to detect actual crashes/failures.
+
`phi = 1` means likeliness that we will make a mistake is about `10%`. The likeliness
is about `1%` with `phi = 2`, `0.1%` with `phi = 3` and so on. Default phi threshold is 10.
+
* `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.sample.size`: Number of samples
to keep for history. Its default value is 200.
* `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.min.std.dev.millis`: Minimum
standard deviation to use for the normal distribution used when calculating phi.
Too low standard deviation might result in too much sensitivity.

To use _Phi Accrual Failure Detector_, configuration property
`hazelcast.heartbeat.failuredetector.type` should be set to `"phi-accrual"`.

[[ping-failure-detector]]
== Ping Failure Detector

The Ping Failure Detector may be configured in addition to one of Deadline and
Phi Accrual Failure Detectors. It operates at Layer 3 of the OSI protocol and
provides much quicker and more deterministic detection of hardware and other
lower level events. This detector may be configured to perform an extra check
after a member is suspected by one of the other detectors, or it can work in
parallel, which is the default. This way hardware and network level issues are
detected more quickly.

This failure detector is based on `InetAddress.isReachable()`.
When the JVM process has enough permissions to create RAW sockets, the
implementation chooses to rely on ICMP Echo requests. This is preferred.

If there are not enough permissions, it can be configured to fallback on
attempting a TCP Echo on port 7. In the latter case, both a successful
connection or an explicit rejection is treated as "Host is Reachable".
Or, it can be forced to use only RAW sockets. This is not preferred as
each call creates a heavy weight socket and moreover the Echo service is
typically disabled.

For the Ping Failure Detector to rely **only** on ICMP Echo requests,
there are some criteria that need to be met.

[[requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration]]
=== Requirements and Linux/Unix Configuration

* **Supported OS: as of Java 1.8 only Linux/Unix environments are supported**.
This detector relies on ICMP, i.e., the protocol behind the `ping` command.
It tries to issue the ping attempts periodically, and their responses are used
to determine the reachability of the remote member. However, you cannot simply
create an ICMP Echo Request because these type of packets do not rely on any of
the preexisting transport protocols such as TCP. In order to create such a request,
you must have the privileges to create RAW sockets (see https://linux.die.net/man/7/raw[https://linux.die.net/man/7/raw^]).
Most operating systems allow this to the root users, however Unix based ones
are more flexible and allow the use of custom privileges per process
instead of requiring root access. Therefore, this detector is supported only on Linux.
* **The Java executable must have the `cap_net_raw` capability.** As described in
the above requirement, on Linux, you have the ability to define extra capabilities
to a single process, which would allow the process to interact with the RAW sockets.
This interaction is achieved via the capability `cap_net_raw`
(see https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities[https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities^]).
To enable this capability run the following command:
+
`sudo setcap cap_net_raw=+ep <JDK_HOME>/jre/bin/java`
+
* **When running with custom capabilities, the dynamic linker on Linux rejects
loading the libs from untrusted paths.** Since you have now `cap_net_raw` as a
custom capability for a process, it becomes suspicious to the dynamic linker
and throws an error: `java: error while loading shared libraries: libjli.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
** To overcome this rejection, the `<JDK_HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/jli/` path needs
to be added in the `ld.conf`. Run the following command to do this:
`echo "<JDK_HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/jli/" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/java.conf && sudo ldconfig`
* **ICMP Echo Requests must not be blocked by the receiving hosts.**
`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all` set to `0`.
Run the following command:
+
`echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all`

If any of the above criteria isn't met, then the `isReachable`
always falls back on TCP Echo attempts on port 7.

To be able to use the Ping Failure Detector, please add the following properties in your Hazelcast declarative configuration file:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.enabled">true</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.parallel.mode">true</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.timeout">1000</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.max.attempts">3</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.interval">1000</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.icmp.ttl">0</property>
    </properties>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The following are the property descriptions:

* `hazelcast.icmp.enabled`: Enables legacy ICMP detection mode, works cooperatively with the existing failure detector and only kicks-in after a pre-defined period has passed with no heartbeats from a member. Its default value is `false`.
* `hazelcast.icmp.parallel.mode`: Enabling the parallel ping detector, works separately from the other detectors. Its default value is `true`.
* `hazelcast.icmp.timeout`: Number of milliseconds until a ping attempt is considered failed if there was no reply. Its default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* `hazelcast.icmp.max.attempts`: Maximum number of ping attempts before the member/node gets suspected by the detector. Its default value is `3`.
* `hazelcast.icmp.interval`: Interval, in milliseconds, between each ping attempt. 1000ms (1 sec) is also the minimum interval allowed. Its default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* `hazelcast.icmp.ttl`: Maximum number of hops the packets should go through. Its default value is `0`.

In the above configuration, the Ping detector attempts 3 pings, one every second and waits up to 1 second for each to complete. If after 3 seconds, there was no successful ping, the member gets suspected.

To enforce the <<requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration, Requirements>>, the property `hazelcast.icmp.echo.fail.fast.on.startup` can also be set to `true`, in which case, if any of the requirements
isn't met, Hazelcast fails to start.

Below is a summary table of all possible configuration combinations of the ping failure detector.

| Legacy ping mode. This works hand-to-hand with the OSI Layer 7 failure
detector (see. phi or deadline in the sections above). Ping in this mode
only kicks in after a period when there are no heartbeats received, in which
case the remote Hazelcast member is pinged up to a configurable count of attempts.
If all those attempts fail, the member gets suspected. You can configure this
attempt count using the `max-attempts` configuration element listed above.
