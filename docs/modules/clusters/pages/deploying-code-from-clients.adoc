= Deploying User Codes on Clients
[[client-user-code-deployment-beta]]

You can also deploy your code from the client side for the following
situations:

. You have objects that run on the cluster via the clients such as
`Runnable`, `Callable` and `EntryProcessor`.
. You have new user domain objects which need to be deployed into the cluster.

When this feature is enabled on the client, the client will deploy the classes
to the members when connecting. This way, when a client adds a new class, the
members do not require a restart to include it in their classpath.

You can also use the client permission policy to specify which clients
are permitted to use User Code Deployment. See the xref:security:native-client-security.adoc#permissions[Permissions section].

== Configuring Client User Code Deployment

Client User Code Deployment feature is not enabled by default. You can
configure this feature declaratively or programmatically.

Following are example configuration snippets:

**Declarative Configuration:**

In your `hazelcast-client.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <user-code-deployment enabled="true">
        <jarPaths>
            <jarPath>/User/example/example.jar</jarPath>
            <jarPath>example.jar</jarPath> <!--from class path -->
            <jarPath>https://com.example.com/example.jar</jarPath>
            <jarPath>file://Users/example/example.jar</jarPath>
        </jarPaths>
        <classNames>
            <!-- for the classes available in client class path -->
            <className>example.ClassName</className>
            <className>example.ClassName2</className>
        </classNames>
    </user-code-deployment>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/ClientUCD.java[tag=clientucd]
----

[[client-user-code-deployment-note]]
=== Important to Know

Note that User Code Deployment should also be enabled on the members to use this feature.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
UserCodeDeploymentConfig userCodeDeploymentConfig = config.getUserCodeDeploymentConfig();
userCodeDeploymentConfig.setEnabled( true );
----

See the <<member-user-code-deployment-beta, Member User Code Deployment section>> for more information on enabling it on the member side and its configuration properties.

For the property `class-cache-mode`, Client User Code Deployment supports only the `ETERNAL` mode, regardless of the configuration set on the member side (which can be `ETERNAL` and `OFF`).

For the property, `provider-mode`, Client User Code Deployment supports only the `LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES` mode, regardless of the configuration set on the member side (which can be `LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES`, `LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY` and `OFF`).

The remaining properties, which are `blacklist-prefixes`, `whitelist-prefixes` and `provider-filter` configured on the member side, effect the client user code deployment's behavior too. For example, assuming that you provide `com.foo` as a blacklist prefix on the member side, the member discards the classes with the prefix `com.foo` loaded by the client.

=== Adding User Library to CLASSPATH

When you want to use a Hazelcast feature in a non-Java client, you need to make
sure that the Hazelcast member recognizes it. For this, you can use the `/user-lib`
directory that comes with the Hazelcast package and deploy your own library to the member.
Let's say you use Hazelcast Node.js client and want to use an entry processor.
This processor should be `IdentifiedDataSerializable` or `Portable` in the Node.js client.
You need to implement the Java equivalents of the processor and its factory on the member side,
and put these compiled class or JAR files into the `/user-lib` directory. Then you can run
the `start.sh` script which adds them to the classpath.

The following is an example code which can be the Java equivalent of
entry processor in the Node.js client:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/settingupclusters/IdentifiedEntryProcessor.java[tag=iep]
----

You can implement the above processor's factory as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/settingupclusters/IdentifiedFactory.java[tag=if]
----

And the following is the configuration for the above factory:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <serialization>
        <data-serializable-factories>
            <data-serializable-factory factory-id="5">
                IdentifiedFactory
            </data-serializable-factory>
        </data-serializable-factories>
    </serialization>
</hazelcast>
----

Then, you can start your Hazelcast member by using the start scripts
(`start.sh` or `start.bat`) in the `/bin` directory. The start scripts
automatically adds your class and JAR files to the classpath.
