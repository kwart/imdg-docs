= Discovery Mechanisms
[[discovery-mechanisms]]

A Hazelcast cluster is a network of cluster members that run Hazelcast.
Cluster members  automatically join together to form a cluster. This automatic
joining takes place with various discovery mechanisms that the cluster members
use to find each other.

Please note that, after a cluster is formed, communication between cluster members
is always via TCP/IP, regardless of the discovery mechanism used.

Hazelcast uses the following discovery mechanisms.

NOTE: See the https://hazelcast.com/resources/hazelcast-deployment-operations-guide/[Hazelcast IMDG Deployment and Operations Guide^]
for advices on the best discovery mechanism to use.

[[tcp]]
== TCP

You can configure Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster. See the
xref:discovering-by-tcp.adoc[Discovering Members by TCP section for configuration details.

[[multicast]]
== Multicast

With this mechanism, Hazelcast allows cluster members to find each other
using the multicast communication. See the
xref:discovering-by-multicast.adoc[Discovering Members by Multicast section].

If you prefer to use this mechanism, make sure that your network is secure.
Since multicast packets are being broadcasted, any member from anywhere can join
the cluster with the appropriate cluster name, so you have less control on the cluster.

Note also that if User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is blocked, as it is for most of the production environments,
discovering with multicast does not work.

[[aws-cloud-discovery]]
== AWS Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast supports EC2/ECS auto-discovery. It is useful when you
do not want to provide or you cannot provide the list of possible
IP addresses. See the xref:plugins:cloud-discovery.adoc#hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-aws[Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast AWS section].

[[azure-cloud-discovery]]
== Azure Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast offers a discovery strategy for your Hazelcast applications
running on Azure. See the xref:plugins:cloud-discovery.adoc#hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-azure[Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast Azure section].

[[gcp-cloud-discovery]]
== GCP Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast supports discovering members in the https://cloud.google.com/compute/[GCP Compute Engine^]
environment. You can easily configure Hazelcast members discovery, WAN replication,
and Hazelcast Client to work seamlessly on the native GCP VM Instances.
This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin.
See the xref:plugins:cloud-discovery.adoc#hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-gcp[Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast GCP section].

[[apache-jclous-cloud-discovery]]
== Apache jclouds® Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast members and native clients support jclouds® for discovery. This mechanism allows applications to be deployed in various cloud infrastructure ecosystems in an infrastructure-agnostic way. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. See its https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jclouds/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for information on configuring and using it.

[[kubernetes-cloud-discovery]]
== Kubernetes Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast provides Kubernetes discovery mechanism that looks for IP addresses of members.
See the xref:plugins:cloud-discovery.adoc#hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-kubernetes[Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast Kubernetes section].

[[eureka-cloud-discovery]]
== Eureka Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast supports the Eureka V1 discovery.
See the xref:plugins:cloud-discovery.adoc#hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-eureka[Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast Eureka section].

[[zookeeper-cloud-discovery]]
== Zookeeper Cloud Discovery

This discovery mechanism provides a service based discovery strategy by using
Apache Curator to communicate with your Zookeeper server.
See the hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-zookeeper, Cloud Discovery Plugins: Hazelcast Zookeeper section>>.

[[hazelcast-for-pcf]]
== Hazelcast for Tanzu VMware

Using a clickable Hazelcast Tile for VMWare (former Pivotal Cloud Foundry), you can
deploy your Hazelcast cluster on PCF. This feature is provided as a Hazelcast
plugin.
See the xref:installation:deploying-in-vmware-tanzu.adoc[Deploying in VMware Tanzu section].
