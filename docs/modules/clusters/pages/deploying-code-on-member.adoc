= Deploying User Codes on the Member
[[member-user-code-deployment-beta]]

Hazelcast can dynamically load your custom classes or domain classes from other
members. A xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#enabling-lite-members[lite member] can be designated as a _class
repository_, but any member can _provide_ classes to other members. For this
purpose Hazelcast offers a distributed dynamic class loader.

The following is a brief working mechanism of the User Code Deployment feature:

. A new dynamic class loader is created to handle each operation.
. It first checks locally available classes, i.e. the member's classpath. If
the class is found, it is used.
. Then it checks the _cache_ of classes loaded from remote members or clients
(if caching is enabled on your local member, see the
<<configuring-user-code-deployment>> section). If your class is found there, it
is used.
. Finally, the dynamic class loader checks configured remote members, one by
one. If some member returns the class, it will be used. It can also put this
class into the local class cache as mentioned in the previous step.
. If the class is not found, `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown.
. The dynamic class loader is released after the operation is handled. A next
operation will load the class from the cache or re-fetch it.

== Configuring User Code Deployment

User Code Deployment feature is not enabled by default. You can control local
caching of the classes loaded from other members, control classes to be
provided to other members and create blacklists and whitelists of classes and
packages.

Following are example configuration snippets:

**Declarative Configuration:**

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <user-code-deployment enabled="true">
        <class-cache-mode>ETERNAL</class-cache-mode>
        <provider-mode>LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY</provider-mode>
        <blacklist-prefixes>com.foo</blacklist-prefixes>
        <whitelist-prefixes>com.bar.MyClass</whitelist-prefixes>
        <provider-filter>HAS_ATTRIBUTE:lite</provider-filter>
    </user-code-deployment>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/MemberUCD.java[tag=ucd]
----

User Code Deployment on the member has the following configuration:

* `enabled`: Specifies whether dynamic class loading is enabled or not. Its
default value is "false" and it's a mandatory attribute. If feature is
disabled, the member will never load classes from other members or clients.
* `<class-cache-mode>`: Controls the local caching behavior for the classes
loaded from remote members (classes loaded from clients are always cached).
Available values are:
** `ETERNAL`: Cache the loaded classes locally. This is the default value and
suitable when you load long-living objects, such as domain objects stored in a map.
** `OFF`: Do not cache the loaded classes locally. It is suitable for loading
runnables, callables, entry processors, etc.
* `<provider-mode>`: Controls which classes are served to other cluster
members. Available values are:
** `LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES`: Serve classes loaded from both local classpath
and from other members. This is the default value.
** `LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY`: Serve classes from the local classpath only. Classes
loaded from other members are used locally, but they are not served to other members.
** `OFF`: Never serve classes to other members.
* `<blacklist-prefixes>`: Comma separated class/package name prefixes that
the member will never attempt to load from other members and that the client
won't be allowed to upload. For example, if you set it to "com.foo", remote
loading of all classes from the "com.foo" package is prevented, including the
classes from all its sub-packages. If you set it to "com.foo.Class", then
"Class" and all classes starting with "Class" in the "com.foo" package are
blacklisted. There are built-in prefixes which are always blacklisted.
These are as follows:
** `javax.`
** `java.`
** `sun.`
** `com.hazelcast.`
* `<whitelist-prefixes>`: Comma separated name prefixes of classes/packages
only from which the classes are allowed to be loaded. It allows to quickly
configure remote loading only for classes from selected packages. It can be
used together with blacklisting. For example, you can whitelist the prefix
"com.foo" and blacklist the prefix "com.foo.secret". If the list is empty, all
classes are allowed.
* `<provider-filter>`: Filter to constrain members that can be used for a class
loading request when a class is not available locally. The value is in the
format "HAS_ATTRIBUTE:foo". When it is set to "HAS_ATTRIBUTE:foo", the class
loading request is only sent to the members which have "foo" as a
xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#defining-member-attributes[member attribute]. Setting this to null allows
loading of classes from all members. See an example in the next section.

[[example-for-filtering-members]]
== Example for Filtering of Members

As described above, the configuration element `provider-filter` is used to
limit members that can be used to load classes. The attribute required in the
`provider-filter` must be set as a member attribute on the members from which
the classes are to be loaded. See the following examples provided as
programmatic configurations.

The below example configuration allows the Hazelcast member to load classes only from the members with the `class-provider` attribute set. It does not ask any other member to provide a locally unavailable class:

[source,java]
----
Config hazelcastConfig = new Config();
DistributedClassloadingConfig distributedClassloadingConfig = hazelcastConfig.getDistributedClassloadingConfig();
distributedClassloadingConfig.setProviderFilter("HAS_ATTRIBUTE:class-provider");

HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(hazelcastConfig);
----

And the below example configuration sets the attribute `class-provider` for a member. So, the above member loads classes from the members who have the attribute `class-provider`:

[source,java]
----
Config hazelcastConfig = new Config();
MemberAttributeConfig memberAttributes = hazelcastConfig.getMemberAttributeConfig();
memberAttributes.setAttribute("class-provider", "true");

HazecastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(hazelcastConfig);
