= Discovering Members by Multicast
[[discovering-members-by-multicast]]

With the multicast auto-discovery mechanism, Hazelcast allows cluster members to find
each other using multicast communication. The cluster members do not need to know the
concrete addresses of the other members, as they just multicast to all the other members
for listening. Whether multicast is possible or allowed depends on your environment.

To set your Hazelcast to multicast auto-discovery, set the following configuration
elements. See the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#multicast-element[multicast element section] for the full
description of the multicast discovery configuration elements.

* Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to `true`.
* Set `multicast-group`, `multicast-port`, `multicast-time-to-live`, etc. to your
multicast values.

The following is an example declarative configuration.

        <join>
            <multicast enabled="true">
                <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
                <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
                <multicast-time-to-live>32</multicast-time-to-live>
                <multicast-timeout-seconds>2</multicast-timeout-seconds>
                <trusted-interfaces>
                    <interface>192.168.1.102</interface>
                </trusted-interfaces>
            </multicast>
            <tcp-ip enabled="false">
            </tcp-ip>
            <aws enabled="false">
            </aws>
        </join>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

Pay attention to the `multicast-timeout-seconds` element. `multicast-timeout-seconds`
specifies the time in seconds that a member should wait for a valid multicast
response from another member running in the network before declaring itself the
leader member (the first member joined to the cluster) and creating its own cluster.
This only applies to the startup of members where no leader has been assigned yet. If
you specify a high value to `multicast-timeout-seconds`, such as 60 seconds, it means
that until a leader is selected, each member waits 60 seconds before moving on. Be careful
when providing a high value. Also, be careful not to set the value too low, or the members
might give up too early and create their own cluster.

NOTE: Multicast auto-discovery is not supported for Hazelcast native clients yet.
However, we offer Multicast Discovery Plugin for this purpose. See the
xref:discovering-native-clients.adoc[Discovering Native Clients section].
