= Discovering Members by TCP
[[discovering-members-by-tcp]]

If multicast is not the preferred way of discovery for your environment,
then you can configure Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster. When you configure
Hazelcast to discover members by TCP/IP, you must list all or a subset of the members'
host names and/or IP addresses as cluster members. You do not have to list all of these
cluster members, but at least one of the listed members has to be active in the cluster
when a new member joins.

To configure your Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster, set the following
configuration elements. See the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#tcp-ip-element[tcp-ip element section] for the
full descriptions of the TCP/IP discovery configuration elements.

* Set the `enabled` attribute of the `tcp-ip` element to `true`.
* Provide your `member` elements within the `tcp-ip` element.

The following is an example declarative configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <join>
            <multicast enabled="false">
            </multicast>
            <tcp-ip enabled="true">
                <member>machine1</member>
                <member>machine2</member>
                <member>machine3:5799</member>
                <member>192.168.1.0-7</member>
                <member>192.168.1.21</member>
            </tcp-ip>
        </join>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

As shown above, you can provide IP addresses or host names for `member` elements.
You can also give a range of IP addresses, such as `192.168.1.0-7`.

Instead of providing members line-by-line as shown above, you also have the option
to use the `members` element and write comma-separated IP addresses, as shown below.

`<members>192.168.1.0-7,192.168.1.21</members>`

If you do not provide ports for the members, Hazelcast automatically tries the
ports 5701, 5702 and so on.

By default, Hazelcast binds to all local network interfaces to accept incoming
traffic. You can change this behavior using the system property `hazelcast.socket.bind.any`.
If you set this property to `false`, Hazelcast uses the interfaces specified in the `interfaces`
element (see the xref:network-configuration.adoc#interfaces[Interfaces Configuration section]). If no interfaces are
provided, then it tries to resolve one interface to bind from the `member` elements.
