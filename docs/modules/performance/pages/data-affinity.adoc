= Data Affinity

Data affinity ensures that related entries exist on the same member. If related data is on the same member, operations can
be executed without the cost of extra network calls and extra wire data. This feature is provided by using the same partition keys for related data.

== PartitionAware

**Co-location of related data and computation**

Hazelcast has a standard way of finding out which member owns/manages each key object.
The following operations are routed to the same member, since all of them are operating based on the same key `"key1"`.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map mapA = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapA" );
Map mapB = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapB" );
Map mapC = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapC" );

// since map names are different, operation will be manipulating
// different entries, but the operation will take place on the
// same member since the keys ("key1") are the same
mapA.put( "key1", value );
mapB.get( "key1" );
mapC.remove( "key1" );

// lock operation will still execute on the same member
// of the cluster since the key ("key1") is same
hazelcastInstance.getLock( "key1" ).lock();

// distributed execution will execute the 'runnable' on the
// same member since "key1" is passed as the key.
hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService().executeOnKeyOwner( runnable, "key1" );
----

When the keys are the same, entries are stored on the same member.
But we sometimes want to have related entries stored on the same member, such as a customer and his/her order entries.
We would have a customers map with customerId as the key and an orders map with orderId as the key.
Since customerId and orderId are different keys, a customer and
his/her orders may fall into different members in your cluster. So how can we have them stored on the same member?
We create an affinity between customer and orders. If we make them part of the same partition then
these entries will be co-located. We achieve this by making `orderKey` s `PartitionAware`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/performance/OrderKey.java[tag=orderkey]
----

Notice that OrderKey implements `PartitionAware` and that `getPartitionKey()` returns the `customerId`.
These make sure that the `Customer` entry and its ``Order``s are stored on the same member.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map mapCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "customers" );
Map mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "orders" );

// create the customer entry with customer id = 1
mapCustomers.put( 1, customer );

// now create the orders for this customer
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 21, 1 ), order );
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 22, 1 ), order );
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 23, 1 ), order );
----

Assume that you have a customers map where `customerId` is the key and the customer object is the value.
You want to remove one of the customer orders and return the number of remaining orders.
Here is how you would normally do it.

[source,java]
----
public static int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception {
    IMap<Long, Customer> mapCustomers = instance.getMap( "customers" );
    IMap mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "orders" );

    mapCustomers.lock( customerId );
    mapOrders.remove( new OrderKey(orderId, customerId) );
    Set orders = orderMap.keySet(Predicates.equal( "customerId", customerId ));
    mapCustomers.unlock( customerId );

    return orders.size();
}
----

There are couple of things you should consider.

* There are four distributed operations there: lock, remove, keySet, unlock. Can you reduce
the number of distributed operations?
* The customer object may not be that big, but can you not have to pass that object through the
wire? Think about a scenario where you set order count to the customer object for fast access, so you
should do a get and a put, and as a result, the customer object is passed through the wire twice.

Instead, why not move the computation over to the member (JVM) where your customer data resides.
Here is how you can do this with distributed executor service.

. Send a `PartitionAware` `Callable` task.
. `Callable` does the deletion of the order right there and returns with the remaining
order count.
. Upon completion of the `Callable` task, return the result (remaining order count). You
do not have to wait until the task is completed; since distributed executions are asynchronous,
you can do other things in the meantime.

Here is an example code.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

    public int removeOrder(long customerId, long orderId) throws Exception {
        IExecutorService executorService = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService("ExecutorService");

        OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask(customerId, orderId);
        Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(task);
        int remainingOrders = future.get();

        return remainingOrders;
    }

    public static class OrderDeletionTask
            implements Callable<Integer>, PartitionAware, Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware {

        private long orderId;
        private long customerId;
        private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;

        public OrderDeletionTask() {
        }

        public OrderDeletionTask(long customerId, long orderId) {
            this.customerId = customerId;
            this.orderId = orderId;
        }

        @Override
        public Integer call() {
            IMap<Long, Customer> customerMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap("customers");
            IMap<OrderKey, Order> orderMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap("orders");

            customerMap.lock(customerId);

            Predicate predicate = Predicates.equal("customerId", customerId);
            Set<OrderKey> orderKeys = orderMap.localKeySet(predicate);
            int orderCount = orderKeys.size();
            for (OrderKey key : orderKeys) {
                if (key.orderId == orderId) {
                    orderCount--;
                    orderMap.delete(key);
                }
            }

            customerMap.unlock(customerId);

            return orderCount;
        }

        @Override
        public Object getPartitionKey() {
            return customerId;
        }

        @Override
        public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
            this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;
        }
    }
----

The following are the benefits of doing the same operation with distributed `ExecutorService` based on the key:

* only one distributed execution (`executorService.submit(task)`), instead of four
* less data is sent over the wire
* less lock duration, i.e., higher concurrency, for the `Customer` entry since
lock/update/unlock cycle is done locally (local to the customer data)

== PartitioningStrategy

Another way of storing the related data on the same location is using/implementing
the class `PartitioningStrategy`. Normally (if no partitioning strategy is defined),
Hazelcast finds the partition of a key first by converting the object to binary and then by hashing this binary.
If a partitioning strategy is defined, Hazelcast injects the key to the strategy and
the strategy returns an object out of which the partition is calculated by hashing it.

Hazelcast offers the following out-of-the-box partitioning strategies:

* `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`: Default strategy. It checks whether the key implements `PartitionAware`.
If it implements, the object is converted to binary and then hashed, to find the partition of the key.
* `StringPartitioningStrategy`: Works only for string keys. It uses the string after `@` character as the partition ID.
For example, if you have two keys `ordergroup1@region1` and `customergroup1@region1`,
both `ordergroup1` and `customergroup1` fall into the partition where `region1` is located.
* `StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy`: Works as the combination of the above two strategies.
If the key implements `PartitionAware`, it works like the `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`.
If it is a string key, it works like the `StringPartitioningStrategy`.

Following are the example configuration snippets. Note that these strategy configurations are **per map**.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="name-of-the-map">
        <partition-strategy>
             com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
        </partition-strategy>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  map:
    name-of-the-map:
      partition-strategy: com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
----
====

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig("name-of-the-map");
PartitioningStrategyConfig psConfig = mapConfig.getPartitioningStrategyConfig();
psConfig.setPartitioningStrategyClass( "StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy" );

// OR
psConfig.setPartitioningStrategy(YourCustomPartitioningStrategy);
...
----

You can also define your own partition strategy by implementing the class `PartitioningStrategy`.
To enable your implementation, add the full class name to your Hazelcast configuration using either
the declarative or programmatic approach, as exemplified above.

The examples above show how to define a partitioning strategy per map.
Note that all the members of your cluster must have the same
partitioning strategy configurations.

You can also change a global strategy which is applied to all the data structures in your cluster.
This can be done by defining the `hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class` system property.
An example declarative way of configuring this property is shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class">
            com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
        </property>
    </properties>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  properties:
    hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class: com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
----
====

You can specify the aforementioned out-of-the-box strategies or your custom
partitioning strategy.

You can also use other system property configuring options as explained in the
xref:configuration:configuring-with-system-properties.adoc[Configuring with System Properties section].

The per map and global (cluster) partitioning strategies are supported on the member side.
Hazelcast IMDG Java clients only support the global strategy and it is configured
via the same system property used in the members (`hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class `).
